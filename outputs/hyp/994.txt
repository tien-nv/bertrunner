it looks like a doll âs house that âs been dropped from a great height.
this was susan house âs beloved home after a huge explosion ripped off two of the walls and left the rest of the property on the brink of collapse.
susan house amazingly survived a huge gas explosion that ripped through her farmhouse - because she was out walking her dogs at the time fire crews were called after a tremendous blast was heard , blowing the back wall and windows out and causing substantial damage to the roof ms bleak house went for a stroll shortly before the detached property exploded yesterday afternoon , leaving a scene of destruction a bath tub can be seen teetering over the edge of what was once the upstairs bathroom after the explosion , which miraculously injured no one the 55 - year - old âs house may be in ruins but she can count herself extremely lucky to be alive â having left to take her dogs for a walk in the spring sunshine not long before the blast.
she returned to find it looking like a bomb site , with rubble strewn across her garden and her belongings left exposed to the elements
