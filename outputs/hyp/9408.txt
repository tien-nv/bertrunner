it is not the first advertising billboard in which a company has used the image of a svelte , bikini - clad model to sell its wares and it probably wo nât be the last.
the company is facing a massive backlash over its billboard campaign â including vandalised posters , a petition , a protest rally and even a bomb threat.
the â body shaming â campaign has seen many of its posters defaced with feminist slogans , more than 50,000 people sign a petition to have them removed and a demonstration planned for this weekend in protest.
richard staveley , protein world âs head of global marketing , added : â it âs been a brilliant campaign for us and i do nât see us changing anything dramatically any time soon
