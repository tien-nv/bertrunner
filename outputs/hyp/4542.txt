a shocking new video appearing to show at least 30 christians being beheaded and shot by isis in libya has been released.
the 29 - minute video , titled ' until it came to them - clear evidence ' , shows dozens of militants holding two separate groups captive , thought to be in the south and the west of the country.
at least 16 men , described by islamic state as the ' followers of the cross from the enemy ethiopian orthodox tewahedo church ' , are lined up and shot in a desert area while 12 others are filmed being forced to walk down a beach before being beheaded.
this follows another video in february of the beheading of a group of 21 coptic christians on the beach in libya , though that terrain was rockier than the one shown in the latest film
