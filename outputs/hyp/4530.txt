a connecticut teenager with cancer who took her fight to stop her chemotherapy treatments to the state 's supreme court must remain in custody of the state even though her disease has gone into remission , a judge ruled on wednesday.
superior court judge taylor in middletown , connecticut , denied requests made last month by attorneys for both cassandra and her mother , fortin , that the 17 - year - old be released from the temporary custody of the state department , or that her mother be permitted to visit her in the hospital.
the judge ruled on wednesday she must remain in department custody until completing court - ordered chemotherapy for hodgkin 's lymphoma , a type of blood cancer , at connecticut children 's medical center in hartford.
the state supreme court then ruled against cassandra 's claim that she was mature enough to make her own medical decisions
