all eyes were again on james anderson as england on thursday night began their push for victory here but instead the limelight was seized by jordan with his second stunning catch of the first test.
a day that featured a fourth antiguan test century in only his ninth match for ballance ended with the leader of england âs attack still waiting for the wicket that will bring him level with sir botham âs test record.
so well did ballance and england bat that cook was able to set west indies a target of 438 in just over four sessions that would even surpass their own world record successful test chase.
cook , though , will be grateful for the athleticism of jordan and the off - spin of joe root for the wicket that means england remain firm favourites to secure today what would be a highly valuable victory for them
