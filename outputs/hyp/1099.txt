comcast is abandoning its bid to buy time warner cable for $ 45.2billion and create a mega-size tv and internet provider , it was reported today.
the move comes after fcc decided that merger was n't in the public interest and threw up a regulatory roadblock following fierce opposition from net neutrality activists and content providers like disney and 21st century fox.
bloomberg , followed by the new york times , reported thursday afternoon that comcast is planning to ' walk away ' from the deal rather than fight it out with the federal government.
the new company would have spun off or sold 3.9million customers the proposed merger would have controlled 57percent of the broadband internet market and 30 percent of the paid tv market with more than 27million customers across the nation
