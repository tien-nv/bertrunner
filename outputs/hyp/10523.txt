the fbi has confirmed that one of its most wanted terrorists , the malaysian bomb maker known as marwan , was killed in an otherwise disastrous raid in the philippine in january.
marwan , whose real name is zulkifli bin hir , was believed by the fbi to a member of southeast asian terror group jemaah islamiyah 's central command.
the fbi said in february that a dna sample -- understood to be from a severed finger -- taken from a man killed in a raid in the southern philippine showed a link with a known relative of marwan.
" after a thorough review of forensic data and information obtained from our philippine law enforcement partners , the fbi has assessed that terrorism subject , zulkifli abdhir ... is deceased and has been removed from the fbi 's list of most wanted terrorists , " bowdich , assistant director in charge of the fbi 's los angeles field office , told cnn in a statement
