dongguan , china for a decade , the new south china mall -- the biggest shopping mall in the world -- has been an embarrassment for its owners and china.
opened to the public in 2005 in dongguan in the south of the country , the goal was to attract 100,000 visitors a day with an array of entertainment , shops and eateries.
outside the mall , a giant egyptian sphinx and a replica of the arc de triomphe were erected alongside fountains and canals complete with venetian gondolas.
soon , it was classified by industry analysts as a " dead mall " and it became an unflattering symbol of china 's runaway speculation on real estate projects
