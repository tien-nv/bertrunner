married to both george harrison and clapton , model pattie was one of the most envied women in the world.
yesterday at the age of 71 , she wed for a third time â with a soundtrack provided by her irish terrier freddie who did his best to upstage the bride and her new groom , property developer rod weston.
there were still splashes of style , of course , from the bentley that took the happy couple to their wedding breakfast at the uber - trendy beaumont hotel in mayfair to the presence of pattie âs fellow sixties model edina ronay.
but there were no groupies or hangers - on as there had been when she married clapton in 1979 or george harrison in 1966 â just a handful of close friends and family who threw confetti as pattie and rod weston , who have been together almost 25 years , emerged from the cream - painted rossetti room arm in arm
