police remain hopeful they will find missing 11 - year - old luke who went missing from a campsite in victoria on friday.
an increased number of police and other emergency crews continue to scour the thick bushland areas around lake eildon in an effort to find the boy.
search co-ordinator acting senior sergeant andrew walker said luke had a â very high pain tolerance â , a factor that would work in his favour given he has now been missing for days.
the 11 - year - old , who is autistic , was reportedly seen walking near the devils river on sunday , four kilometres south of his campsite where he was last seen
