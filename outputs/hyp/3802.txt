russian yesterday lifted a ban on supplying iran with an air defence missile system which could be used to protect nuclear sites.
vladimir putin gave the go - ahead for the deal , with the defence ministry saying it was ready to supply the s - 300 missile equipment â promptly â.
the move is likely to anger both the us and israel at a time of heightened tensions between the world powers and following a landmark deal on nuclear weapons.
moscow blocked deliveries of the surface to air missiles to iran in 2010 after the un imposed sanctions on tehran over its nuclear programme , barring hi - tech weapons sales
