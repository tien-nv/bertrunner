a lonely pensioner left half a million pounds to a builder who once agreed to clean out his gutters for free - but the bequest is now at the centre of a high court legal battle.
ronald butcher , a ' private and quiet man ' , bequeathed his entire Â£ 500,000 fortune to daniel sharp after he died in march 2013.
but his relatives and family friends insist that the will , made just two months before his death , is invalid and say that the builder is lying about his friendship with mr ronald butcher.
