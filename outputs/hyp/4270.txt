cameron will put small business at the heart of the election campaign today by declaring that the conservatives are â the party of the grafters â.
the prime minister , who has faced criticism over a campaign lacking in passion , said he made â no apology â for focusing on the economy , insisting : â nothing matters more.
â he will appeal to small firms and the self - employed , saying while labour sneers at those who work hard , his party backs them.
and he told voters : â i want you to think about the three million low - paid people we have taken out of income tax , i want you to think about the two million jobs that we have created , i want you to think of the cuts in youth unemployment that we âve achieved
