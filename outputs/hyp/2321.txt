arsene wenger admits he did not expect arsenal âs late charge for the top of the premier league to be powered by hector bellerin and coquelin.
arsene wenger had all but given up on coquelin when he was sent on loan to charlton before christmas and did not expect hector bellerin to progress with such speed after a year at watford.
â honestly , i could nât say that in my head coquelin was one of the first - choice players , â said the arsenal manager.
coquelin ( right ) has played a vital role in arsenal 's late push for the premier league title â hector bellerin is one of the surprises of the season
