self - styled ' anarchist libertarian ' squatters have set up camp in one of london 's most historic monuments and unfurled banners reading ' homes for all '.
the protesters mounted admiralty arch , which joins trafalgar square with the mall , and called for others to join them.
it is not clear what their protest is attempting to highlight , as a garbled message posted on facebook by the group simply calls for ' christmas lights ... any and all radical / revolutionary messages '.
but banners bearing messages such as ' better squat than let homes rot ' and ' respect existence or expect resistance ' were seen hanging from the grade - i listed building , as the masked demonstrators sat with their legs dangling over the side
