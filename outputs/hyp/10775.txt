the listeria outbreak that prompted blue bell to recall their entire product line dates to 2010 , according to the cdc.
after weeks of gradual recalls , the company recalled all its ice cream , frozen yogurt , sherbet and other frozen treats sold in 23 states because they could be contaminated with listeria monocytogenes , the company said monday.
the bacteria can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children , the elderly and others with weak immune systems.
