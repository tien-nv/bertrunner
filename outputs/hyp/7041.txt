hundreds of tourists had to be evacuated from warwick castle after a flaming cannonball set alight to a medieval thatched building during a display.
holidaymakers , many with young children enjoying the last day of the easter break , had gathered to watch the cannonball be fired from the wooden trebuchet â the largest working siege machine in the world.

the thatched building , which overlooks the river avon within the castle grounds in warwickshire , was unoccupied when it became engulfed in fire at about 5.45pm yesterday
