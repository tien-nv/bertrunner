for a self - professed champion of women 's rights , espn sports reporter mchenry has a funny way of showing it.
the 28 - year - old has been suspended from the network for a week after being caught on camera telling a parking lot attendant she should ' lose some weight , baby girl ' , adding ' i 'm on television and you 're in a f --- ing trailer , honey '.
