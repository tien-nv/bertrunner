labour will today accuse the tories of making it harder to see a gp as they attempt to put the nhs back at the centre of the election campaign.
the party will launch a billboard advert using the image from the famous 1979 â labour is nât working â poster , but instead it will warn : â the doctor ca nât see you now â.
the poster features the same long line of people used to illustrate dole queues under jim callaghan âs ailing government , but this time places them outside a waiting room.
shadow health secretary andy burnham will say the figures are a timely reminder of the â nhs crisis â as patients turn to stretched a&e departments as they struggle to get an appointment with their gp on the first working day after the easter break
