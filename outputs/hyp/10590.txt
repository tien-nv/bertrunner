the mass killings of armenians in the ottoman , which began 100 years ago friday , is said by some scholars and others to have been the first genocide of the 20th century , even though the word " genocide " did not exist at the time.
the issue of whether to call the killings a genocide is emotional , both for armenians , who are descended from those killed , and for turkey , the heirs to the ottoman.
some armenians feel their nationhood can not be fully recognized unless the truth of what happened to their forebears is acknowledged.
some turkey still view the armenians as having been a threat to the ottoman in a time of war , and say many people of various ethnicities -- including turkey -- were killed in the chaos of war
