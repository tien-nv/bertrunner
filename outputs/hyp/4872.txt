when president obama dined with a dozen technology business leaders in california four years ago , it was google executive chairman schmidt who sat at the head of the table.
obama sat on one side , between the late apple co-founder steve jobs and facebook pioneer mark zuckerberg , but the place of honor was no accident.
google executives and employees donated more than $ 1.6 million to obama 's two white house campaigns , and the online search giant parachuted top talent into both.
one result has been a coziness with the u.s. government 's executive branch that few other companies can match â marked by access for lobbyists , mentions in nearly half of obama 's state of the union addresses , and a personnel feeder trough serving the white house with new senior hires
