two black candidates were among three people elected to the ferguson city council tuesday , tripling african-american representation in the st. louis suburb where poor race relations have been a focal point since the august shooting death of an 18 - year - old black by a white police officer.
the election means that half of the six - member city council in ferguson , a town where two - thirds of the 21,000 residents are black , will now be african - american.
this just over one month after the justice department released a report on the shocking culture of racism and abuse in the city.
the lone black incumbent councilman , dwayne james , was not up for re-election
