a father who was arrested for using medical cannabis on his critically ill two - year - old daughter has pleaded for the government to legalise the drug as her health continues to decline.
after hearing positive stories about the benefits of using the controversial treatment , the 32 - year - old cairns man decided to give cannabis oil to his daughter who is battling a rare form of cancer called neuroblastoma.
despite his claims that it improved her condition , the father , who can not be named for legal reasons but has been nicknamed ' fearless father ' , was charged with administering a dangerous drug to a minor and was refused access to his sick daughter.
now he has spoken out in the hope that he can persuade the government to rethink their cannabis laws and drop the charges against him
