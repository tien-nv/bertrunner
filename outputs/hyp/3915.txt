a russia military analyst has said that his country should develop weapons that can cause a nightmare scenario of tsunamis and volcano eruptions in the us , potentially killing hundreds of millions.
konstantin sivkov , who writes a column for the military-industrial courier , wrote earlier this month that russia needed new ' megaweapons ' to unleash chaos and guarantee destruction of its enemies.
in an article titled ' nuclear special forces ' he said that russia should develop nuclear weapons manned by a small force that can cause tsunamis on the us coasts and force a volcano in yellowstone to erupt.
