just before writing this column , i reached into the depths of my wallet , and in between the pilot licenses , i slid out a postage stamp - size certificate issued by the faa.
the certificate documents my successful completion of the dc special flight rules area , or sfra , online course.
the online course verifies that i am knowledgeable to fly a plane under visual flight rules into the most highly restricted u.s. airspace in the country.
although a " no - fly zone " over the white house has long existed , the sfra airspace was developed to protect the washington area further after the 9/11 terrorist attacks
