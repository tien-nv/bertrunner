the jailing of four blackwater security guards , eight years after they killed 17 iraq civilians in a shooting in baghdad , is a positive step for justice -- but is also not enough.
the kind of horror represented by the blackwater case and others like it -- from abu ghraib to the massacre at haditha to cia waterboarding -- may be largely absent from public memory in the west these days , but it is being used by the islamic state in iraq and syria ( isis ) to support its sectarian narrative.
in its propaganda , isis has been using abu ghraib and other cases of western abuse to legitimize its current actions in iraq as the latest episodes in over a decade of constant " sunnis resistance " to " u.s. aggression " and to " shiite betrayal " â as phrased in an isis publication from late 2014 titled " the revived caliphate , " which chronicles the rise of isis since 2003.
as the iraq government today struggles to regain the support of sunnis in its fight against isis -- or even renew intra-sunni trust -- this invocation of u.s. transgressions by isis should be a sobering reminder of the importance of good governance in the pursuit of a solution to the unrest in iraq
