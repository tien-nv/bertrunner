jesus christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals , according to a writer and leading atheist activist.
david fitzgerald , a san francisco based author , believes he has compiled compelling evidence that proves jesus christ did not exist.
he claims there are no contemporary mentions of jesus christ in historical accounts from the time when he was supposed to have lived , yet other jewish sect leaders from the time do appear.
instead he insists the disciples of jesus christ were also probably not real and their names only later attached to the gospels to lend them credence
