a wall street banker raped an irish student in a ' disgusting , violent attack ' because he was determined to have sex on his birthday , a court heard on wednesday.
lee forced himself on the 20 - year - old in a bathroom and told her to ' shut the f * * * up ' so her friends in the next room would not hear.
the assault ended when the girl kneed him in the groin and staggered out in such a â hysterical â state she was unable to talk.
lee tried to downplay the incident and said it was ' no big deal ' and dismissively told the first police officer on the scene : ' we 're good , you can go ' , the court heard
