there will be calls for england to get rid of cook and trott on the back of their failures here but i think they should both play all three tests against west indies before any sort of decision is made.
we are talking about two batsmen with phenomenal test records who have done it against australia in the past and , with good players like that , you do not jettison them easily.
cook , for instance , will end up with one of the greatest of all england records and you have to give people of that calibre every possible chance to show they are worth a place.
trott ( left ) and cook head out to open england 's second innings against west indies trott walks past cook after he was dismissed for just four runs by jerome taylor on day three i said after the first day of this test that england âs top order was a bit one - paced which could be an issue but that does not mean i think they should be dropped unless there is conclusive evidence they are in decline
