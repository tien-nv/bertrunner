usually a highlight of mbfwa , perry 's name is a notable absence from the schedule in 2015.
the designer revealed in february that he would not be presenting a collection at the sydney event this week , and revealed to dma on sunday that he was enjoying ' taking a breather '.
despite this year marking the 20th anniversary of mbfwa , perry is taking in the fashions from the comfort of the front row , after focusing on his international efforts of late.
' my team and i just need a bit of a breather - we 've just finished selling in paris , and we 've had an incredible season over there , so we 're busy focusing on international at the moment , ' perry told dma at the ellery show on first night of fashion week
