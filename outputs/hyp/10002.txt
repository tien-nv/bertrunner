as this image gets larger , what do you see ? most people will pick out a phantom - like picture of einstein.
but if you see a hollywood pin - up , you may need a trip to the opticians.
at normal viewing distance , healthy eyes should be able to pick up the fine lines on einstein 's face , causing the brain to disregard marilyn monroe 's image altogether.
features with a high spatial frequency ( einstein ) are only visible when you 're viewing them close up , and those with low spatial frequencies ( marilyn monroe ) are only visible from further away
