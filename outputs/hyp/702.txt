she was the pregnant teenager who horrifically murdered her american socialite mother in a wealthy bali resort and heartlessly stuffed the half - naked body in a suitcase.
heather mack , 19 , brutally killed sheila von wiese-mack with the help of her boyfriend in august and dumped the bloody suitcase in a taxi outside the upscale st. regis bali resort.
mack avoided the death penalty last week when a judge sentenced her to 10 years , a relatively light sentence that took into consideration her need to care for her newborn.
in contrast , australian chan and sukumaran have spent the past decade on death row after they were convicted of trying to smuggle heroin from bali to australian in 2005
