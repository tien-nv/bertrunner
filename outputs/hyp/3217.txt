a washington state lawmaker has proposed the idea of connecting two cities on the puget sound with a military tribute bridge made of retired navy aircraft carriers.
representative young wants to use two or three carriers to link bremerton and port orchard across the sinclair inlet.
a proposal put forth by young which would use money from the state 's highway budget to fund a feasibility study about the bridge passed in the washington house on thursday.
the idea is intriguing because the navy is storing three retired carriers just a few hundred yards from the proposed site of the bridge
