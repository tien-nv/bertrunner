ed miliband has been accused of stooping to a ' shameful ' new low by blaming cameron for the mediterranean refugee crisis.
the labour leader used a keynote campaign speech today to suggest the deaths of hundreds of refugees fleeing north africa could have been avoided if the prime minister had done more following his intervention in libya to remove the former dictator colonel gaddafi.
in a briefing note sent out before the speech , labour went further - claiming the crisis was ' in part a direct result ' of mr cameron 's foreign policy.
the allegation provoked a furious response from the tories who this morning demanded that mr ed miliband apologise for the ' outrageous and disgraceful ' remarks
