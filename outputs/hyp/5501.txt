lucas would like to remind people it is not just steven gerrard playing out his own emotional journey in sunday 's fa cup semi-final against aston villa at wembley.
the brazilian has been at anfield for eight years and holds the unwanted record of playing more games for liverpool without winning a major trophy than anyone else in 50 years.
he missed the 2012 capital one cup final and two other wembley appearances that year with a serious knee injury sustained against chelsea the previous november.
his story might not have the celebrity appeal of steven gerrard saying goodbye in an fa cup final on his 35th birthday , but the desire to win the fa cup is just as strong
