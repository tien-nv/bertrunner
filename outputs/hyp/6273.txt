a doctor who ploughed into an elderly couple in a 50mph head on crash while rushing to work has escaped prosecution after the police officer investigating the case went off sick.
the female driver in a toyota pulled in front of colin kay as he was driving his citroen picasso on the a586 in great eccleston in lancashire last year.
the collision was captured on film as mr colin kay had fitted a camera to his dashboard and revealed how he had no time to react and avoid the crash.
but despite having evidence recorded on his dashcam , mr colin kay has now been told there will be no further action because the investigating officer went off sick and they could not prepare the paperwork in time
