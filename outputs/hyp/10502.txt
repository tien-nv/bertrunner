boardwine 's path to fatherhood was unconventional , but virginia 's appeals court said tuesday he is legally entitled to be a part of his son 's life.
boardwine 's friend , joyce bruce , had used his sperm and a turkey baster to get pregnant.
she also thought that because they never had sex , she was entitled to be the boy 's sole parent , according to court documents.
the court of appeals of virginia decided differently in weighing the commonwealth 's assisted conception statute and denying bruce 's appeal to deny boardwine visitation
