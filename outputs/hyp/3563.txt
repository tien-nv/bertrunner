but for me there is one standout contender for manager of the year and that 's louis van gaal.
manchester united boss louis van gaal is among those in the running for manager of the year manchester united 's players celebrate together during the derby win against rivals man city wayne rooney , young and juan mata celebrate during the 4 - 2 win against man city manuel pellegrini is punching above his weight at man city ... the club must think big or forever remain small forget eden hazard and michael carrick ... the best player in the barclays premier league this weekend was leicester city 's jamie vardy how stupid do some english football ' experts ' look now ? after the early - season defeats at mk dons and leicester city , they were laying into van gaal.

how many managers could have made young look convincing in a manchester united shirt ? at the start of the season i was asking the question about chris smalling and phil jones â could they make the centre - half spots their own ? i think that question is still pertinent , but those two played very well against man city and are starting to look the part in the old trafford back four
