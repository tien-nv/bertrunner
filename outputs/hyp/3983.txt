this image shows the wing of a sunset moth the photos were shot by linden gledhill from staffordshire , who combines his love of photography with a phd in biochemistry.
the 51 - year - old uses a modified microscope and a camera to capture the detail of the butterfly 's wing pattern.
some of the scales look like exotic bird feathers , while others resemble autumnal leaves that change colour at the outer edges , such as this beautiful image of a detached scale from a tiger swallowtail the tiny scales combine to give the striking colouration of the eastern tiger swallowtail ( stock image ).
it is a species of swallowtail butterfly native to eastern north american and is one of the most familiar butterflies in the eastern us , where it is common in many different habitats each scale of a butterfly is pigmented with melanins that give butterflies black and brown colouring , but eye - catching blues , greens , reds and iridescence ( pictured ) are created by the microstructure of the scales , rather than pigments
