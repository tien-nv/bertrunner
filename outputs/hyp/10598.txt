a door bearing a graffiti drawing by british artist banksy was seized by police in gaza on thursday after a dispute over its sale , a gaza police official told cnn on thursday.
the owner of the door , rabea darduna , filed a complaint with a gaza court stating that , without realizing its value , he sold the door for just $ 175 u.s. the iron door will remain in the possession of the khan younis police in southern gaza until a court hearing at a date yet to be determined.
when rabea darduna 's gaza home was destroyed in last summer 's war , he says he felt he was left with nothing.
" rabea darduna says he was duped into believing the door was a normal door when it was really a canvas for banksy , one of the world 's most famous graffiti artists , who had painted a greek goddess with her head in her hand
