greg dyke has vowed there will be no repeat of the fa âs failure to deliver potentially life - saving research into links between concussion and early on - set dementia.
the fa chairman admits his organisation âs response to former west brom striker jeff astle âs death aged 59 in 2002 , from â industrial disease â linked to repetitive head injuries sustained playing football , was â woefully inadequate â.
the fa and pfa promised a 10 - year study to investigate the connection between head injuries and early on - set dementia after a coroner found jeff astle âs brain â resembled that of a boxer âs â but a mail on sunday investigation last year revealed the research was never carried out.
