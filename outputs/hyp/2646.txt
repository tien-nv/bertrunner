some of the 2,500 police officers who were involved in tracking down the boston marathon bombers showed a lack of ' weapons discipline ' during two firefights with the brothers , a new report reveals.
in the first standoff , the officers fired ' toward the vicinity ' of tamerlan and dzhokhar tsarnaev ' without necessarily having identified and lined up their target ' , the 130 - page document states.
shortly after the firefight in watertown , massachusetts , on april 19 , 2013 - which resulted in the death of tsarnaev - an officer mistakenly fired on a police vehicle carrying two other cops.
upon closer inspection , the officer discovered that the occupants of the vehicle were a boston police department officer and a massachusetts state police trooper in plain clothing , the document says
