the aurora movie theater shooter studied brain disorders as a doctoral student before he killed 12 people and injured 70 more in one of america 's deadliest mass shootings.
prosecutors said holmes , 27 , was once a sought - after neuroscientist - in - training , but evidence shows that months before the shooting he was preparing for violence.
the prosecution is trying to prove that holmes was not mentally ill and knew exactly what he was doing the night of july 20 , 2012 , when he opened fire during the midnight premiere of the batman film ' the dark knight rises '.
if the 12 final jurors , chosen from a pool of 9,000 , decide that holmes was mentally ill at the time of the shooting , he will be committed indefinitely to a state psychiatric hospital
