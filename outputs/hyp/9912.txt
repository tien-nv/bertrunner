a week after 10 doctors urged columbia to sever all ties with him , dr. oz has used his syndicated tv show to hit back and claim that the criticism is part of a conspiracy because of his views on genetically modified foods.
the celebrity doctor did n't pull any punches in thursday 's episode of the dr. dr. oz show which was called the truth about his critics.
the doctors accused him of being a ' charlatan ' who promotes ' quack treatments ' and as someone who ' has repeatedly shown disdain for science and for evidence - based medicine , as well as baseless and relentless opposition to the genetic engineering of food crops '.
' it 's ironic that i am being accused of a conflict of interest by these doctors , when , as you are about to see , some of them have their own conflict of interest issues - and some integrity ones also , ' he said on thursday 's show
