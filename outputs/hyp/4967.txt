the 150 people killed in the germanwings air disaster in the french alps have been remembered at a memorial service in germany today.
the cardinal who led the service at the historic cologne cathedral urged forgiveness for all of the victims - including co-pilot lubitz who is widely blamed for ' deliberately ' crashing the jet after locking the captain out of the cockpit.
an investigation into the disaster revealed that lubitz previously suffered from severe depression and his home computer showed he had researched ways of committing suicide.
