two warring sisters were yesterday stripped of the right to control their aged mother âs fortune because of the intensity of the hatred between them.
the hostility between the women â one a 61 - year - old retired gp and the other a 58 - year - old radiographer â meant they would never be able to make rational decisions about how to deal with the 97 - year - old widow âs property , a judge said.
senior judge denzil lush said the elder sister could be jailed for attempting to alter a legal document , so she could gain greater control over her mother âs money.
she owns a Â£ 600,000 house , has savings and shares worth Â£ 100,000 , and has an income of Â£ 1,200 a month
