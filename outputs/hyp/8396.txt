authorities in montgomery county have released the 911 call that led to two ' free range ' getting picked up and held by police and cps for five hours over the weekend.
the unnamed caller gave the operator a blow - by - blow account as he wandered behind rafi , 10 , and his sister dvora , 6 , in silver spring on sunday.
the 7 - minute call would reignite a controversy focused on those kids and their scientist parents , danielle and alexander meitiv , who espouse the hands - off parenting style.
the caller , who was out walking his dog in the suburb adjacent to washington , dc , said he saw ' two kids that are unaccompanied , and they 've been walking around for probably about 20 minutes by themselves
