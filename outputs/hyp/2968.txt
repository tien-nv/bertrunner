the senate voted on thursday to approve lynch as president obama 's next attorney general , ending a five - month deadlock that made lynch wait longer for confirmation than the last seven attorneys general combined.

curiously absent from the final vote was texas senator cruz - a key opponent of lynch 's nomination.
a copy of a cruz for president invitation later began flying around twitter that showed the gop presidential candidate had skipped town early to make an appearance at a fundraiser at the home of former texas rangers owner and billionaire tom hicks
