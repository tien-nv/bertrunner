as bamford fired home his 19th boro goal of the season on tuesday night , there was one question on everybody âs lips : can he make the grade at chelsea next season ? the 21 - year - old striker has been prolific in his loan spells at boro , derby and mk dons , so much so that sportsmail understands his parent club are opening talks with him over a new deal.
needless to say it would see his wages rise from his current Â£ 7,500 - a - week deal.
he will also be given the chance to impress mourinho on chelsea âs summer tour although at the end of it he is expected to go out on loan again.
this time , though , bamford will be sent to a premier league club , preferably aitor karanka âs boro should they join the blues in the top flight
