after years of suffering behind its barbed wire fences , watching those they loved waste away before their eyes while nazi guards systematically slaughtered them by the tens of thousands - this is the moment the inmates of bergen-belsen watched as the death camp was burned to the ground.
steeped in human misery , these huts once contained the bodies of thousands of jewish , gypsies , homosexuals , nazi opponents and the disabled , sent to an inhuman death by hitler and his demented regime.
shortly after the camp was liberated by british and canadian troops in 1945 , it was torched , and at least part of that suffering was destroyed forever as the buildings , along with the german reichskriegs flag and hitler portrait which adorned them , were consumed by flames.
