two chapters of the zeta beta tau fraternity are under investigation after they allegedly disrespected disabled veterans by spitting on them , shouting verbal abuse and urinating on the american flag during a charity weekend.
students from zeta beta tau at both the university of florida and emory university in atlanta , georgia , have been accused of the deplorable behavior against the ex-servicemen during the warrior beach retreat in panama city on april 17.
the event is designed to give those who have sacrificed their lives for their country a relaxing break with their families at the luxurious lakedown wharf resort.
but instead of being acknowledged for their service , some of the attendees claim they were subjected to taunts and watched as the drunk youngsters , who were attending a formal , threw beer off the balcony
