in 1982 , hollywood - born chanteuse charlene had a surprise worldwide hit with i 've never been to me.
' i 've moved like harlow in monte carlo , ' she sang , ' and showed ' em what i got â¦ ' ( actually , when the song became a hit she was in straitened financial circumstances and working in a sweetshop in ilford , essex , so instead of moving like harlow she could have been singing about moving to harlow.
) one of the most irritating lyrics in the song - it has many - is when she sings about the ' isle of greece ' , as if she were discussing the isle of man or the isle of wight.
do n't take this the wrong way , americans , but is there anybody in your country with a geography o - level to their name ? this may come as a surprise to our transatlantic cousins but greek has rather more islands in its portfolio than one - in fact there are more than 6,000 , most of them uninhabited
