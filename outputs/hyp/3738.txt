hernandez left behind his life as a millionaire star athlete today , swapping a designer suit for a set of gray scrubs at a prison where he will begin a life sentence for murder.
it is perhaps fitting that hernandez was booked at cedar junction in walpole , a prison just across the freeway from gillette stadium where he used to play for the patriots.
hernandez has n't set foot in the stadium since june 2013 , when he was arrested under suspicion of murdering odin lloyd , who was dating the sister of hernandez 's fianceÃ© at the time.
on wednesday , a 12 - person jury found hernandez guilty , sentencing him to life in prison without the possibility of parole due to some especially heinous aspects of odin lloyd 's killing
