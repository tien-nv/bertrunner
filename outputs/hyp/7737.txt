united have been brilliant in the second half of the season but the defeat at everton was a timely reminder that they still have a long way to go.
united played like sunderland on a bad day â they were that horrendous.
it 's no surprise to those of us who can see his quality and importance to united , but without michael carrick they look far more beatable.
i ca n't see how everton score that first goal if michael carrick is on the pitch
