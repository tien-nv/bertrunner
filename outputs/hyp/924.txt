when ben stokes first turned up at the kensington oval this week someone would have said : â mind that locker , stokesey.
â it was here , of course , that ben stokes broke his wrist punching a locker after being dismissed last year and that will be a reminder to him of the need to channel his aggression in the right way now he is back in the england team.
ben stokes has forged a reputation as a fiery character in the england cricket team ben stokes ( left ) clashed with marlon samuels during the second test between west indies and england but ben stokes ( right ) responded positively to the row after talking to england coach peter moores only a slight niggle in his back might stop stokes playing here in barbados and i am glad he has fought his way back after what has been a year of ups and downs.
peter moores , england âs coach , dragged him to one side after his clash with marlon samuels in the second test and had a long chat with him and if it was to talk about how he should respond then the advice he gave was clearly right
