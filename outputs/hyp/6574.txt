beaming towards the camera as a toothy 10 - year - old , thompson is the picture of health as he poses in his family 's back garden.
but more than 20 years later the once rosy - cheeked boy is facing death after ballooning to 65 stone to become britain 's fattest man.
consuming 10,000 calories - a - day by gorging on takeaways and whole loaves of bread , the 32 - year - old is too heavy to walk or wash himself.
