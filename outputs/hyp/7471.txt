a workman caught hanging out the door of a van travelling at 85mph down the motorway says he was only doing it because he needed some fresh air.
the man , wearing an orange high - vis jacket , could be seen leaning out the sliding door of the black vauxhall vivaro van as it hurtled down the outside lane of the m40 motorway near oxford.
he appeared to be laughing and making jokes with his colleagues inside the kj rail van as he hung his body - and even a leg - out of the vehicle.
today his boss , who has called the man in for a disciplinary hearing , revealed that the man claims he was only leaning out of the door because he was n't feeling unwell and needed some fresh air
