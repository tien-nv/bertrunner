these are the incredible shots of the american southwest that a photographer captured with a fairly common lens - that of his iphone , to be exact.
armed with just his phone and a sleeping bag , russ hopped trains , dumpster dived for leftovers and slept in ditches as he photographed the lifestyle of a nomad down south.
russ traveled from california to colorado , making his way through arizona , texas and new mexico.
the photographer said he was initially ' fearful and unsure ' when his friend levi approached him with the idea , but did n't let that stop him from the new adventure kirby , texas : and russ said he was immediately excited to embrace the ' nostalgic way of travel '
