whistleblower julian asssange has added insult to injury for sony pictures entertainment after his website wikileaks put hundreds of thousands of emails and documents from last year 's cyberattack into a searchable online archive.
the calculated move by julian assange to expose thousands of indiscreet and personal correspondences will likely spell fresh embarrassment for the embattled company so soon after they hoped the dust had settled on the matter.
julian assange and wikileaks issued a statement on thursday saying that the data has a public interest , but the majority of the correspondences run from the mundane to the deeply personal.
they expose not just the unguarded opinions of sony pictures entertainment executives , but also reveal health concerns about their children and sadness over dying parents
