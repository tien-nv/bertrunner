more than half of scotland plan to back the snp in the general election , shattering miliband 's hopes of securing a labour majority.
snp leader sturgeon has been buoyed by a series of tv debates opposing austerity cuts , despite threatening another referendum on independence.
a new tns survey shows the snp has almost doubled its lead over labour in a month , with 52 per cent now backing ms sturgeon with only 24 per cent of scotland planning to vote for mr miliband.
the poll is a blow to mr miliband on the day he used labour 's manifesto launch to insist he is ' ready ' to be prime minister but labour and the snp have clashed on ms sturgeon 's call for full fiscal autonomy for scotland , and her suggestion that another referendum could be held before 2020
