back in 1989 , khomeini famously said he was " drinking poison " when he accepted a ceasefire to end the eight - year - old war with iraq.
the war had helped define khomeini 's regime , the islamic republic , which he had founded a year before saddam hussein invaded iran.
he dragged out the war for eight years , despite saddam hussein 's willingness to accept a ceasefire , and thus stabilized the foundations of the islamic republic.
since then , " drinking a chalice of poison " has became part of iran political lexicon , and many analysts have asked whether ayatollah khamenei , khomeini 's successor , would raise the chalice and surrender to demands by the west to end iran 's nuclear program
