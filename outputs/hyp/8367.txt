pietersen âs quest for an improbable return to international cricket began as his scriptwriter must have known it would : with sumptuous strokes , a standing ovation and much of the old bravado.
the fact that his first hundred since the old trafford test against australia in august 2013 came against a modest attack , at a windswept oxford , in a game not deemed first - class , is beside the point.
pietersen âs only hope of playing for england again is to score lots of runs for surrey â wind , rain or shine
