the hillary clinton presidential campaign surely anticipated the coming wave of inquiries and criticism about conflicts of interest involving big foreign donors to charities run by the clinton family -- questions set to get a thorough airing in a new book called " clinton cash : the untold story of how and why foreign governments and businesses helped make bill and hillary rich " by peter schweizer , coming out may 5.
my guess is that the issues raised by the book will prompt clinton to put its candidate on the road , where she can continue holding loosely scheduled , informal meetings with ordinary americans -- the sorts of people more concerned about local jobs than whether some foreign government or company paid a big speaking fee to bill clinton in hopes of getting special treatment by secretary of state hillary clinton.
president obama vetoed a bill that would have allowed the pipeline to be built , but it 's legitimate to ask whether the donation from canada directly or indirectly influenced the state department 's analysis.
unless the forthcoming book unveils some blockbuster new information , questions about the clintons ' charities is likely to wind up on the same political shelf on which voters seem to have parked concerns about hillary clinton 's use of private emails to conduct state department business
