the bride - to - be was spotted cheering on her fiancÃ© andy murray yesterday as he battled novak djokovic in the men 's final at the miami open , in an outfit almost identical to two others she wore during the tournament.
kim accompanied her sophisticated dress with a sombre expression as she witnessed novak djokovic beat andy murray again , taking home his fifth miami open title in key biscayne , making her black outfit a fitting choice.
on april 3 kim watched andy murray , 27 , beat tomas berdych of the czech republic in their semi-final match in a high necked black mini dress accompanied with her trusty ray-ban glasses and straw hat
