photographs taken with the very first ' secret ' handheld camera will go on display on saturday at the state library giving sydney a rare chance to take a glimpse of what life in sydney looked like back in the 1800 âs.
the crowd source collection holds around 150 photographs taken by arthur syer , a 27 - year - old man living in sydney who took advantage of the very first hand held camera , the detective camera.
' it was the first time people really had the opportunity to take a photograph without their subjects knowing , â said museum curator and historian riley.
the detective camera gave amateur photographers the opportunity to capture the true essence of life on sydney streets , defining it as a â real revolution and turning point in photography
