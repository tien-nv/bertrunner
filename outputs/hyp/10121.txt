a group of eight - year - old children in new jersey have written letters to convicted cop killer mumia , wishing that he will ' get better soon ' while recovering in hospital from a mystery illness after being encouraged by their teacher.
the cards have caused outrage and alarm among political commentators , many of whom claim the 60 - year - old 's illness is a fraud and clamor for attention.
mumia , who shot philadelphia police officer daniel faulkner in cold blood in 1981 , was taken to hospital on april 2 after collapsing in the bathroom of the state correctional institution at mahanoy.
but this week he was delivered two batches of letters - one from a third grade class in orange , new jersey and another from high school students in the philadelphia student union
