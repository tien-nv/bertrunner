two comedians and a coronation street actress came out in support of labour at a party rally.
ben elton took a swipe at myleene klass over her criticism of miliband 's mansion tax plans , at the event also attended by eddie izzard , joey essex and sally lindsay.
the comedian told a 1,000 - strong crowd at warrington 's parr hall the popstar - who claimed the planned levy on homes worth more than Â£ 2 million would hit ' little grannies ' - had made her money ' showering in a bikini ' and should be ' proud to make a contribution '.
ben elton , who distanced himself from the party under tony blair , told supporters he was ' back with labour '
