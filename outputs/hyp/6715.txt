the man - made quakes jolted once stable regions in eight states , including parts of alabama , arkansas , colorado , kansas , new mexico , ohio , oklahoma and texas.
earthquakes , they said , were sometimes caused by fracking , in which large volumes of water , sand and chemicals are pumped into rock formations to free oil or gas.
researchers say there have been ' substantial increases since 2009 that continue today ' they said the spike in seismic activity was largely down to the oil and gas industry injecting wastewater deep underground , which can activate dormant faults
