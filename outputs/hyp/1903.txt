a woman who allegedly dumped her quadriplegic son in the woods so she could spend the week with her out - of - state boyfriend is now facing an attempted murder charge , police have said.
parler , 41 , has been hospitalized for undisclosed reasons in maryland ever since her 21 - year - old son was found in a pile of wet leaves in cobb creek park in philadelphia last friday.
police believe the man had been left in the woods all week - with nothing but a bible and a blanket - and was exposed to the rain and cold and to wild animals.
parler was initially charged with aggravated assault , kidnapping and neglect of a care - dependent person , and police have now added attempted murder to the list
