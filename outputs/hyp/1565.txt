the liverpool street hotel in london used to be bedlam , but not through cavalier management , rebellious staff or disruptive guests.
the victorian building that houses it is built on the site of english âs first hospital for the mentally ill - the bethlehem hospital , which opened in 1247 and was often pronounced as â bedlam â.
fast forward a few centuries and in its place is a swanky , celebrity - baiting boutique hotel with 267 rooms - four of which have been decorated by trendy artists.
and instead of mental health patients , it 's the likes of beyonce , lil kim and lady gaga that stay here these days
