espn 's britt mchenry this week found herself in the news , rather than reporting on it , after a video surfaced showing her berating and belittling an employee of a tow company in arlington , virginia.
among the highlights , as caught on tape and eventually uploaded to liveleak : " i 'm on television and you 're in a f * * king trailer , honey , " and " i would n't work at a scumbag place like this.
certainly mchenry should have known better than to have used such words , even if that 's what she was thinking , least of all because in our youtube age , such missteps always come to light.
but while mchenry 's reaction could very well have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement , evidence of a mean girl who never left high school , what 's also troubling is how quickly and gleefully the rest of us issued blame on mchenry without fully knowing -- or , it seems , caring about -- the other side of the story
