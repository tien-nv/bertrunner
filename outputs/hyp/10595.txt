i remember traveling one day in the local train in mumbai with my mother , my younger sister and brother.
the stories can be stomach churning : men masturbating on buses and at bus stops , boys stalking young girls -- both physically and online , men taking pictures of women without permission and uploading them on the internet.
a study by we the people found that 80 % of women in mumbai had been street harassed , primarily in crowded areas like trains and railway platforms.
most people , including women , only think of sexual violence as rape and tend to overlook touching , groping and stalking , not to mention the " milder " forms of ogling , leering , catcalling and whistling , even though all of this can be intimidating
