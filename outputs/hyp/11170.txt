the united states and its negotiating partners reached a very strong framework agreement with iran in lausanne , switzerland , on thursday that limits iran 's nuclear program in such a way as to effectively block it from building a nuclear weapon.
just last month , in an attempt to head off such an agreement , house speaker john boehner invited israel prime minister netanyahu to preemptively blast it before congress , and 47 senators sent a letter to the iran leadership warning them away from a deal.
let us address some of these : the most misleading assertion , despite universal rejection by experts , is that the negotiations ' objective at the outset was the total elimination of any nuclear program in iran.
rather , the objective has always been to structure an agreement or series of agreements so that iran could not covertly develop a nuclear arsenal before the united states and its allies could respond
