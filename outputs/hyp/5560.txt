pet aquarium fish are being dumped in rivers where they damage unique local ecosystems by growing up to twenty times their regular size.
goldfish are being caught weighing up to 2kg and koi carp up to 8kg and one metre in length , in the waterways of western australia amongst other exotic introduced species.
' in the south - west of western australia 90 per cent of the fish and 100 per cent of the crayfish are only found there , so the rivers are refuges for the native fish and when they are forced to coexist with introduced species , they just do n't do very well.
a huge murray river cod was removed from a perth wetland in novemeber last year : ' a lot of these fish are much larger than the native fish , so they prey on them and compete for habitat , ' dr morgan , the director of the centre for fish and fisheries research at murdoch university , said pest carps : ' in the south - west of western australia 90 per cent of the fish and 100 per cent of the crayfish are only found there , ' he added ' we 've now found it in three rivers around perth and south of perth
