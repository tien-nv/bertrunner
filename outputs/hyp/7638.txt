snp leader sturgeon today hit back at claims from tory former prime minister sir john that she poses a ' real and present danger ' to the uk.
in a speech today , sir john claimed the snp would use any power they wield in westminster after the election to foster division and further their dream of the break up of the 300 - year - old union.
and he mocked ms sturgeon over her demand to play a role in propping up a labour government , when she is ' not even bothering ' to stand as an mp herself.
labour had argued it would ' kill independence stone dead ' but instead it ' fanned the flame ' which lead to the referendum which left the union ' battered ' but intact
