help for heroes has launched a fundraising drive to keep second world war veteran robert in his own home after a north london council refused to pay for his ongoing care.
brent council said it was no longer able to afford to pay for a live - in carer to stay with the 96 - year - old former prisoner of war , despite the fact that mr robert spent his Â£ 50,000 life savings on contributing to his care.
now , the council want to move mr robert from the house he has lived in for the past 50 years into a care home because they claim it is cheaper.
the charity has already given mr robert and emergency grant to fund his immediate care needs , but they are seeking the public 's help to secure his future
