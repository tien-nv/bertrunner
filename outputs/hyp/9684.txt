the world 's longest ever kidney donation chain linked its final donor to ailing recipient last month when a wisconsin woman became the 34th person whose life was saved by the record - setting program.
mitzi neyens , 77 , was successfully matched with a philadelphia man after turning to the national kidney registry 's paired exchange program -- her only option since her age barred her from receiving a deceased donor 's organ.
when she received the kidney march 26 , the operation completed a nationwide chain that linked strangers from san diego to boston who have loved ones in need with patients desperately in need of a transplant.
