noah does n't take over as daily show host until later this year , but he 's already ingratiating himself with america comedy royalty.
the south african , whose announcement as jon stewart 's replacement surprized many last month , was spotted taking in a baseball game in new york on monday along with seinfeld , larry david and broadway star matthew broadrick.
noah 's very public appearance with new york jewish comedy royalty comes not long after he was accused of anti-semitism in the wake of his surprise promotion to daily show host.
cynics might wonder if monday 's very public appearance with seinfield and larry david was a concerted move to combat that negative publicity but alternatively perhaps the comedian is undertaking a crash course in learning about america culture
