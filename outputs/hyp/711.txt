president obama will once again stop short of calling the 1915 massacre of armenians a genocide , prompting anger and disappointment from those who have been pushing him to use the politically fraught term.
as a candidate for president in 2008 , obama promised to use the term to describe the mass murder if elected but has not followed through despite calls from the most famous armenian-american , kim kardashian , and the pope for the world to recognize the killings as a genocide.
kim kardashian , whose armenian heritage comes from her father , the late robert kardashian , has used her celebrity since at least 2011 to bring awareness to the genocide.
' an emotional day at the genocide museum , ' read a tweet posted by kim kardashian that was accompanied by a photo of her and khloe laying flowers at the genocide monument âs eternal flame
