tsarnaev murdered their 8 - year - old son and permanently maimed their 7 - year - old daughter , but bill and denise richard do not want to see him executed.
in a moving op - ed for the boston globe , published just a day after the two - year anniversary of their son martin 's death , the richards have asked that tsarnaev be spared the death penalty so that they can finally get closure on the darkest chapter of their lives.
last week a jury found tsarnaev guilty on all counts related to the april 15 , 2013 attack on the boston marathon finish line.
