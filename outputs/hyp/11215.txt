as eight of mary jane veloso 's fellow death row inmates -- mostly foreigners , like her -- were put to death by firing squad early wednesday in a wooded grove on the indonesia island of nusa kambangan , the filipina maid and mother of two was spared , at least for now.
her family was returning from what they thought was their final visit to the prison on so - called " execution island " when a philippine tv crew flagged their bus down to tell them of the decision to postpone her execution.
" this is all because of the efforts of the philippine people and the international community who have been with mary jane veloso , her family and the philippine people all throughout , " a supporter said upon hearing of the eleventh - hour reprieve.
mary jane veloso was arrested in 2010 after a flight from malaysia to indonesia when $ 500,000 worth of heroin was discovered in the lining of her luggage
