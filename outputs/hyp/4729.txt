the surrender of confederate gen. robert e. lee to union lt. gen. ulysses s. grant 150 years ago on thursday was a milestone event in the end of the civil war.
thursday 's commemoration in appomattox , virginia , included a reenactment of robert e. lee 's last clash with ulysses s. grant 's troops and of the confederate surrender in a virginia farmhouse on april 9 , 1865.
ahead of the battle reenactment , the boys of the confederate 11th virginia were a seemingly pretty cool bunch as those portraying union troops gathered several fields away at appomattox court house amid the rolling farm country dotted by neat brick buildings and white picket fences.
robert e. lee 's forces were in a state of growing disarray in the hours before robert e. lee formally called it quits
