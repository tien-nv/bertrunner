melissa wilson and her team - mates are on the brink of making history.
on saturday , at the 161st oxford - boat race , the women âs crews will battle the same river thames course as the men , who will follow an hour later.
and for wilson âs grandfather , 85 - year - old richard cowell , from east kilbride , it will be a momentous day.
he is not up to the journey to watch his granddaughter compete for cambridge but will still see the race , which will be televised for the first time
