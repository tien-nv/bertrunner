shia paramilitary fighters looting and setting fire to buildings in tikrit are ' out of control ' , an official said.
ahmed al-karim , head of the salahuddin province provincial council , said the fighters had burnt ' hundreds of houses ' in the last two days.
it comes as prime minister haider al-abadi ordered iraqi forces to oppose vandalism in the city of tikrit , retaken from the islamic state group this week , and arrest those responsible.
