an experiment on the iss will investigate whether plants are able to use a sixth sense while in space - a sense of gravity.
in the weightless environment of the space station , researchers will monitor how plants grow in a particular direction without a noticeable gravitational pull.
the results could help farmers on earth get a higher crop yield - and may also help future astronauts grow plants on missions beyond earth orbit to the moon and mars.
