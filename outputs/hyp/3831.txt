at the end of march , leicester were bottom of the table with 19 points , seven off safety.
for nigel pearson and his men , their season starts now.
so how on earth have leicester won three on the bounce ? only arsenal ( 8 ) and chelsea ( 4 ) can better that as a winning streak.
leicester players are full of confidence after three successive victories in the premier league it has been a superhuman effort and they have fought to get themselves in a position where they have something to play for
