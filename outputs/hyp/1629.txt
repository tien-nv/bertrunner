at least 35 workers have been killed at a dairy factory in yemeni as saudi warplanes continue to bomb shiite rebel positions in both the north and the south of the country.
today 's airstrikes targeted rebel - controlled army camps in the red sea port city of hodeida , and hit warehouses belonging to a factory that produces dairy products.
the jets drew return fire from anti-aircraft guns as the saudi - led campaign to defeat the iran - backed shiite rebels loyal to yemeni 's deposed president ali abdullah saleh entered its seventh day.
the attack on the dairy factory comes as saudi hinted that it was prepared to launch a ground invasion in yemeni in the hope of forcing the houthi rebels to allow current president , abed rabbo mansour hadi to return to the country , after he fled the southern port city of aden last week
