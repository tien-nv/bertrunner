she 's a professional equestrienne and was happy to have a go at wheelchair rugby , a sport nicknamed ' murder ball ' , during last september 's invictus games.
now tindall , 33 , has turned her hand to barrel - pulling - and laughingly pretended to pull her 16st 6ft rugby player husband mike along while striking a pose for the cameras.
the moment came during a charity event to mark the end of personal trainer edmond 's marathon barrel - roll from perthshire to wiltshire.
taking the strain : tindall straps herself into mr edmond 's barrel - pulling harness pull ! tindall pretends to move off while husband mike beams from his perch on the barrel edmond , who set off nine days and 517 miles ago , rolled the whisky barrel for 12 hours a day , only stopping to sleep and take part in comedy gigs at pubs along the way
