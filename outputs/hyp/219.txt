the slain editor of charlie hebdo has slammed his left - wing critics from beyond the grave for criticising publication of drawings of prophet mohammad.
in a book stã©phane charbonnier , known as charb , finished just two days before being murdered by jihadist gunmen he argued that left - leaning intellectuals who denounced the cartoons in the satirical magazine were â ridiculous demagogues â for doing so.
in the short book , extracts of which are to be published today in weekly magazine l'obs , he writes : â the suggestion that you can laugh at everything , except certain aspects of islam , because muslims are much more susceptible than the rest of the population , what is that , if not discrimination ? in a book stã©phane charbonnier ( pictured ) , known as charb , finished just two days before being mowed down by jihadist gunmen he argued that left - leaning intellectuals who denounced the cartoons in the satirical magazine were â ridiculous demagogues â journalists hold placards reading ' i am je suis charlie ' as they hold a minute of silence on january 7 following the attack by gunmen in the offices of charlie hebdo â it 's time to finish with this disgusting paternalism of the white , left - wing bourgeois intellectual seeking to prove himself among the â poor unfortunate undereducated â.
â the book , lettre ouverte aux escrocs de l'islamophobie qui font le jeu des racistes ( open letter to the fraudsters of islamophobia who play into racists ' hands ) , which may well rock the ' je suis charlie ' solidarity over the massacre , argues that some intellectuals who condemned the drawings were merely attention - seekers
