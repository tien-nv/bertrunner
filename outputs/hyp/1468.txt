clarkson and his fellow top gear presenters were just about to renew their lucrative contacts for three more years but they were scrapped when the star punched the show 's producer.
james may , 52 , revealed he had prematurely celebrated the three - year deal by ordering a rare Â£ 200,000 ferrari before clarkson 's sacking after an infamous ' fracas ' with producer tymon.
may says he had ordered the last ever ferrari 458 speciale - in bright orange - while the ' draft version ' of the lucrative contract was sitting on his desk ' with only a few details to resolve '.
but clarkson , 55 , was sensationally sacked by the bbc last month and hammond , 45 , joined may in confirming he will not return to top gear this week
