former england captain mike gatting believes pietersen should not walk straight back into the international set - up , even if he piles on the runs for surrey this season.
pietersen has returned to the lv = county championship in a bid to stake a claim for an england recall , although the 34 - year - old only managed 19 runs against glamorgan on sunday.
england were held to a draw in the opening test of a three - match series against west indies last week , and calls for a pietersen comeback continue to linger ahead of the ashes this summer.
pietersen scored 170 in his first outing for surrey this season but scored just 19 against glamorgan ' there are a few bridges that still need to be rebuilt , ' said mike gatting , who had just penned a congratulation message to jimmy anderson , england 's leading test wicket - taker , as part of slazenger 's celebratory flag tour
