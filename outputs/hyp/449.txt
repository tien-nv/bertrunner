with a possible 11 games left to their season barca âs front three of messi , luis suarez and neymar are just seven goals short of clocking up a century in their first season together.
the three amigos will match the total scored by thierry henry , samuel eto'o and messi in 2009 if they reach 100 goals and they will inevitably fuel the debate that they are fast becoming the greatest front three in barca âs history.
thierry henry scored 26 , etoâo 36 and messi 38 goals in the 2008 - 09 season.
they scored 98 goals in the 2010 - 11 season with messi getting 53 , villa 23 and pedro 21
