a flickering rainbow of colours came with the march solar storm that made the northern lights even more remarkable than usual , and italy photographer giovanna griffo was in iceland to capture them in all their glory.
giovanna griffo , 42 , who is based in latina , led a group of her students to vik and hella in the south of iceland where they were fortunate enough to be blown away by what is said to have been the strongest geomagnetic storm in the current solar cycle.
while giovanna griffo takes and edits all manner of photographs , she has a particular affinity with the night sky - and not just the spectacular aurora borealis but locations in her own country too.
' the northern lights were one of my dreams , so i went some weeks ago to iceland hoping to be lucky enough to get one ! ' i have to say i have been so much more than just lucky , since i got one the most powerful solar storm in the last three years that made an incredibly aurora visible in germany too ! ' giovanna griffo , the daughter of two artists , teaches photography and post-production in seminars all around italy and is also the editor and founder of the photo community www.maxartis.i
