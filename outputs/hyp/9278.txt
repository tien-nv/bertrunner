but a police poster advising women to stick together on a night out provoked anger yesterday , as campaigners claimed it suggested victims were responsible for sex attacks.
sussex police was accused of â victim - blaming â in its campaign , which urges women not to leave their friends alone or let them wander off with strangers.
women âs rights groups said rapists were to blame for sex attacks , not their victims.
anti-rape campaigners have criticised the message in this sussex police poster arguing it implies that victims are to blame for getting raped but the poster won praise from supporters who said it was â blindingly obvious â that it was not blaming women , and that it simply offered â sensible advice â
