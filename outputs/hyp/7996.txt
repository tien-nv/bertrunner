trainer paul webber was on sunday praying the ground at fairyhouse racecourse dries out further for cantlow , who will attempt to give mccoy a glorious send off in ireland with a second victory in easter monday 's irish grand national.
the 19 - time champion won the 2007 running on butler âs cabin and success aboard cantlow would be a fairytale start to what could be mccoy âs final week as a jockey.
he has vowed to immediately retire if he wins saturday âs crabbie âs irish grand national at aintree on favourite shutthefrontdoor , the gelding which won last year âs irish national under barry geraghty.
mccoy will attempt to win the irish grand national on cantlow in his final race meeting in ireland that cantlow disputes favouritism for monday 's race is largely due to the presence of mccoy on his back
