andy erlam has announced he will stand to be the next mayor of tower hamlets - telling voters it is a chance to ' change everything for the better ' the grandfather who won a high court victory to kick out the crooked mayor â of tower hamlets yesterday announced he will stand as a ' martin bell ' - style anti-corruption independent candidate in his place.
andy erlam pledged to end years of ' rotten borough ' politics.
last week mr andy erlam led four ordinary voters who defied threats , financial â ruin and official apathy to have lutfur rahman unseated from office by an electoral court.
lutfur rahman - who police afraid of being branded ' racist ' failed to charge - was found guilty of rigging his election for mayor in may 2014 by a systematic campaign to steal votes
