however , a recent excavation of a cave in the foothills of the pyrenees mountains in spain is suggesting our ancient cousins , the neanderthal , were more in tune with nature.
archaeologists have discovered evidence that neanderthal regularly inhabited the cave of llenes , near senterada in catalonia , around 200,000 years ago but were not alone.
the fossilised remains of badgers were found in old dens within the cave alongside neanderthal camps the remains of other canivores including cave bears , hyenas , leopards , wolves and badgers have been found in the cave and were apparently also living there.
neanderthals , shown in the artist 's impression above , may have lived alongside predators in a cave in spain researchers found several cave bear fossils , similar to the one above , along with scratches on the walls and signs of hibernation nests that suggest they were living in the cave alongside neanderthal 200,000 years ago it is hoped the discoveries will help scientists learn more about neanderthal behaviour and their relationship with the animals they co-existed with
