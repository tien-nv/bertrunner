iran will sign a final nuclear agreement only if economic sanctions against the nation are removed on the first day of the deal 's implementation , president hassan rouhani said thursday.
ayatollah khamenei , the islamic republic 's supreme leader , meanwhile , told state - run media outlets he is neither in favor nor against the proposed deal because it is n't final , and he 's not certain it will become binding because he has " never been optimistic about negotiations with the u.s. " six world powers and iran reached a preliminary deal last week that aims to limit tehran 's nuclear program in exchange for lifting economic sanctions.
the u.s. , however , has stressed that if a final deal is reached with iran , the removal of any sanctions will come in phases.
negotiators from iran and the u.s. , china , germany , france , britain and russia have until june 30 to come up with a final deal
