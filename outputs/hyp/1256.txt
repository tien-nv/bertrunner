thousands of people have signed a petition calling for a controversial weight loss advertisement to be pulled , as katie hopkins slammed those complaining about the posters as ' chubsters '.
the bright yellow advert for protein world has been put up in a number of london underground stations and features a model in a bikini with the question : ' are you beach body ready ? '.
