the days of filling your car with petrol may be numbered because researchers have boosted the efficiency of making hydrogen fuel from plant waste.
us scientists have found a way to use discarded corn husks and stalks to make cheap hydrogen fuel that does n't pollute the environment like fossil fuels.
the breakthrough could one day see the fuel being produced locally and drivers stopping to refuel their vehicles at roadside bioreactors instead of pumping petrol into their motor.
us scientists have found a way to use discarded corn husks and stalks to make cheap hydrogen fuel that does n't pollute the environment like fossil fuels and it could accelerate the take up of biogas for cars eco-friendly hydrogen cars , which are already a reality , emit only water , but the gas is expensive and is not easy to store , meaning more research is needed for hydrogen cars to become mainstream
