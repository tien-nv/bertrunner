mi5 covered up the sexual abuse of boys in the notorious kincora home , a former army intelligence officer claimed last night.
brian gemmell , a former captain in the army intelligence corps , said spy chiefs ordered him to â stop digging â when he reported a possible paedophile ring at the northern ireland children âs â home.
he spoke out during a meeting with victim kerr , who claimed he was one of three youngsters trafficked from the home before being molested by â very powerful â figures in a westminster paedophile gang.
