a woman who tipped the scales at almost 20st has shed nearly half her body weight after she was forced to stand during an 11 - hour flight - because she feared she was crushing the woman in the seat next to her.
sharon smith , 43 , from halesowen , west midlands , was a bulky size 26 when she went on the business trip in december 2012 and struggled to fit in the plane seat.
today she weighs in at a healthy 9st 9lb and is due to run a 10k race on sunday , when two years she would have struggled to walk half a mile , let alone run six.
her weight loss began just under two years ago when she joined weight watchers online , but did not weigh herself immediately
