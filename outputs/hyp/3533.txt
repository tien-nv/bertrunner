the first high - resolution footage of solar flux ropes on the sun has been revealed.
research led by a scientist at the new jersey institute of technology has revealed the first high - resolution footage of a solar flux ' rope ' taking shape on the sun , shown in this still image the new footage was revealed in a paper in nature communications led by dr wang from the new jersey institute of technology.
a solar flare accompanies the twisting flux rope in the footage , which moves around a common axis before bursting from the sun. they are essentially twisted bundles of magnetic field that extend out of and back into the surface across hundreds of kilometres.
in the video , twisting groups of magnetic fields writhe around a central axis , and the rope ultimately causes a bright flash - a solar flare - to form , shown here dr wang and his colleagues made the findings using the 5.2ft ( 1.6 metres ) new solar telescope at the big bear solar observatory in california
