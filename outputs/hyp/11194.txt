the best part of the supreme court oral arguments about marriage equality was when justice ginsburg alluded to s&m.
ok , she did n't actually mention s&m , but ginsburg talked about how the institution of marriage has already changed from long ago , when it was " a dominant and a subordinate relationship.
clarence thomas did n't say one way or the other , though his remarks outside court and in dissenting opinions suggest he 's firmly opposed to the supreme court doing for other loving relationships what it once did for his own.
but perhaps the example of clarence thomas speaks to what seems most glaring about the oral arguments in the marriage equality cases , namely that just as with the rest of america , the supreme court seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
