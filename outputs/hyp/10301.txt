councils are pocketing thousands in change by forcing drivers to overpay for parking because their meters do not accept five or 10 pence coins brought in three years ago.
town halls have failed to recalibrate some of the 100,000 ticket machines in the uk - making it impossible for drivers to pay the exact cost of parking.
in manchester , where 240 machines are still not upgraded , motorists without old - style coins must use Â£ 1 and two 20p pieces for a typical Â£ 1.25 hour 's parking - handing the council a 15p profit.
big profit : town hall bosses in manchester have been accused of pocketing thousands of pounds extra from 240 parking ticket machines in the city because they still do not accept new 5p and 10p pieces the council also charges Â£ 1.85 for an hour and a half and Â£ 3.10 for two hours and 30 minutes , meaning that drivers without the right coins must overpay for them too
