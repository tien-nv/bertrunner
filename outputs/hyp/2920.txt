a russian biker gang , which vladimir putin describes as his ' friends ' , has camped out on the poland border after being banned from entering the country for a wwii memorial ride.
poland authorities said last week they would ban entry to the night wolves , with leaders calling their plans to ride through poland en route to commemorations of wwii a ' provocation '.
the group vowed to enter anyway and 15 were seen monday morning at the border crossing between brest , belarus , and terespol , poland.
poland is extremely critical of russian actions in ukraine , and is disturbed that the night wolves has rallied against the ukraine government and celebrated russian 's annexation of crimea
