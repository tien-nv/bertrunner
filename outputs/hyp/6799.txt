supporters of isis have ' declared a caliphate ' in yemen through a bizarre video showing a group of masked fighters a barren desert.
the video , allegedly shot near the capital of sanaa , sees some 20 men wearing desert camouflage uniforms carry out a carefully choreographed rifle routine in the sand.
the ' establishing ' of an isis - related group in yemen comes after months of conflict which has seen iran - backed houthi rebels fight both the government and the local al-qaeda affiliates.
last month , the isis - related group claimed responsibility for a series of coordinated suicide bomb attacks at two mosques in the houthi - controlled capital of sanaa
