the days of soft old arsenal not liking it up ' em when they get north of watford are long gone.
a first - half strike by the outstanding aaron ramsey was enough to see off burnley at an intimidating turf moor and record an eighth win in a row by arsene 's side , the best run since the invincibles team managed it in 2004.
arsenal have won at sunderland , newcastle , manchester city and now burnley , and picked up points at liverpool and everton , besides beating manchester united in the fa cup at old trafford.
the only exception was a 3 - 2 defeat at stoke and even then they nearly clawed back a 3 - 0 deficit
