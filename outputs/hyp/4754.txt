sturgeon tonight backed the immediate transfer of all tax powers to holyrood in a move that threatens a multi-billion pound cut to scots 's budget.
the first minister was forced to admit her mps would vote for fiscal autonomy as early as next year , despite the catastrophic collapse in north sea oil revenues.
such a move would leave a massive Â£ 7.6billion black hole in scots 's finances , triggering either higher taxes , deeper spending cuts or unsustainable borrowing levels.
sturgeon said she would back calls for all tax powers to be devolved to scots ' as soon as possible ' , but labour leader jim murphy ( right ) warned this would leave a catastrophic hole in the country 's budget miss sturgeon struggled once again in a tv election clash screened by the bbc , just a day after she faced an audience backlash by refusing to rule out a snap second referendum on independence
