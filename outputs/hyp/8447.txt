one of britain 's top entrepreneurs has unveiled a new plan to build a block of flats worth as much as Â£ 2billion on the site of an ugly multi-storey car park.
john caudwell , the founder of phones4u , bought the audley street garage in mayfair , central london for Â£ 155million in order to knock it down and build a high - end housing complex.
the new apartment block will contain five townhouses , three penthouses , a mews home and 21 more luxury flats , rivalling properties such as one hyde park for the title of the world 's most desirable living space.
