tesco is under pressure to axe 200 stores â on top of 100 already closed or cancelled â after the supermarket giant announced a record annual loss of Â£ 6.38billion.

as a result , tesco has been forced to slash the value of its property empire and sell off land cheaply , with the loss of thousands of jobs
