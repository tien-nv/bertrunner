this is the time of the year when christians the world over -- more than 2 billion of us -- reflect upon the crucifixion and resurrection of our lord.
in light of the tragic massacre of christian college students in kenya on thursday , and the ongoing threat against christians in other nations , this holy week we are calling upon christians to also reflect upon the crucifixion , beheading , stoning , enforced slavery , sexual abuse , human trafficking , harassment , bombing and displacement of hundreds of thousands of christians -- and others -- whose faith alone has made them a target of religious extremists.
this crisis escalated substantially last summer when isis swept like lightning through iraq 's nineveh province , capturing the country 's second - largest city , mosul ; a city that was until 2014 a home of a thriving christian community , there centuries before islam.
again and again the world did not respond as it might have , and now the inconceivable has happened : iraq 's nineveh plain has been emptied of its ancient christianity community , which existed there for more than 1,500 years
