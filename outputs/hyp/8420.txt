west ham manager allardyce says he would have no problem with sneaking through the â back door â into european football via the fair play league.
the west ham started the season strongly and looked a good bet for european qualification around christmas before their form fell away , with a mid-table finish now all - but certain.
but a reprieve could be granted by the fair play league , with allardyce âs side topping the premier league table for their good behaviour , just ahead of burnley.
if west ham finish top of the pile and england âs top flight is within the top three â fair - playing â leagues in europe â which it was on last count - they will earn a europa league place
