the revered al sharpton appeared on sunday in north charleston and is expected to attend a vigil for scott , the black driver who was fatally shot by a white police officer after he fled a traffic stop.
rev. sharpton preached at the charity missionary baptist church and addressed the scott case and the need for reform around national policing legislation during his sermon.
' the officers and elected officials listened ' intently ' to what sharpton had to say as he gave credit to mayor summey for firing slager , the officer who killed scott , according to the post and courier.
sharpton denied scott 's family barred him from attending his funeral on saturday because it would cause a ' circus ' of media attention
