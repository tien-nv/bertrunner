these three mormon , all from utah , have realized that they are transgender - a designation not officially recognized by the church of latter day saints.
indeed , church doctrine states that anybody who takes their transgender identity to the extent of gender reassignment surgery can not be baptized - and could face discipline from church elders if they are already a member of the religion.
however , in the case of annabel jensen , moore and woodhouse , they have found a way to exist within the mormon universe - often with the help of local mormon leaders.
moore used to be grace and annabel jensen was once christopher changed : woodhouse , above , changed gender much later in life
