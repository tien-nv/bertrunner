khan believes brook has called him out so that he can have the ' one big payday ' which has so far eluded him during his 10 - and - a - half year career.
brook , who defeated jo jo dan to retain his ibf welterweight title last month , immediately challenged khan in a post-fight interview but the bolton - born boxer has instead agreed a bout on may 30 , with his opponent yet to be confirmed.
khan has reiterated his intention to take on brook within the next 12 months , although he insists that the undefeated 28 - year - old only wants the fight because of the money it will earn him.
