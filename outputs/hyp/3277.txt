a grieving widow said she was frightened for the lives of herself and her family thanks to a ' nasty ' neighbour who terrorised them for seven years.
during the course of her harassment , pauline 's neighbour yvonne plagued her with silent calls , taunted her dying husband and attacked her son with secateurs.
it 's not the quiet and peaceful life pensioners pauline and her late husband tony expected when they moved to a static home on a community park for over- 50s in ludlow , shropshire , following tony 's retirement in 2002.
she did n't even show any compassion when tony was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2011 and continued to torment pauline and her son from a previous marriage , john , when they were grieving his death a year later
