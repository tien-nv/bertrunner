in a photo album that spans over china , thailand , vietnam , laos and cambodia , extraordinary images portray the crop 's full cycle from the primitive sowing of seeds to the distribution of millions of tonnes for consumption.
the pictures were taken by professional photographer scott gable , 39 , who spent four months travelling across the region documenting the labour and threadbare equipment used to harvest the carbohydrate - rich food.
the crop accounts for one fifth of all calories consumed by humans and 87 per cent of it is produced in asian.
