a police officer feared for his life when he fired the final shots in a barrage of bullets that killed two unarmed suspects , a court has heard.
brelo , 31 , made his first appearance in court in cleveland , ohio , on monday charged with two counts of voluntary manslaughter for the deaths of timothy russell , 43 , and malissa williams , 30.
he is the lone officer among the 13 who fired their weapons that night who is charged criminally because prosecutors say he stood on the hood and opened fire four seconds after the other officers had stopped shooting.
brelo 's attorney d'angelo conceded that his tactics could be called into question given that brelo exposed himself to danger when he stepped onto the hood of a beat - up chevy malibu to fire 15 rounds into the windshield of the suspects ' vehicle
