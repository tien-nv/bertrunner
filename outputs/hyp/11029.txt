according to a wall street journal report thursday , chinese nuclear experts have told the united states that pyongyang may already have as many as 20 nuclear warheads.
the key takeaway from the latest assessment of north korean 's nuclear capability is not in the actual number of warheads , but the type of warhead , as this gives a better clue to the future of the country 's weapons capabilities.
the big takeaway from the report is instead the prediction that north korean could be in a position to double its arsenal by next year with weapons - grade uranium.
if that assessment is correct , and pyongyang can indeed boost its nuclear stockpile by the end of this year to around 40 warheads by utilizing highly - enriched weapons - grade uranium , then the plutonium program that the united states and members of the six-party talks had been negotiating over this past quarter century would suddenly seem trivial
