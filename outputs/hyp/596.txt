a laser could be mounted on the iss and used to shoot down pieces of space debris in earth orbit , says a new paper.
the system would use a telescope already mounted on the station to find and target pieces of debris up to 62 miles ( 100km ) away.
powerful pulses from the laser would then push space junk into earth âs atmosphere , where it would burn up.
