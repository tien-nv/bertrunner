the england cricket team 's involvement with multi-billion - pound fraudster allen stanford â an all - time low point â has been defended by west indies cricket legend sir curtly ambrose.
great fast bowler curtly ambrose never spoke to the media during his playing career but launched his aptly titled autobiography time to talk on the eve of the west indies - england series.
