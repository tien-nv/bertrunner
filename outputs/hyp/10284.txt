cameron has called on people to ' feel proud to say this is a christian country ' , in his annual easter message.
as the election campaign slowed to mark the easter weekend , the prime minister hailed the work of the church and condemned the persecution of christians following the massacre in kenya.
mr cameron 's praise for the church comes after he criticised bishops for a controversial election letter calling for a ' fresh moral vision of the kind of country we want to be ' which was widely seen as an attack on the coalition 's welfare cuts.
in his video message the prime minister , who has defended the right of the church to intervene in political debate , said easter was ' time to reflect on the part that christian plays in our national life '
