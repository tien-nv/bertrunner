celtic manager deila will try to persuade jason denayer and manchester city to extend the centre - back 's loan deal next season - but hearts captain danny wilson is also among his defensive targets.
jason denayer made his full international debut in belgium 's 1 - 0 european championship qualifying victory in israel on tuesday night , coming on as a substitute after vincent kompany was sent off.
the 19 - year - old also faces competition from kompany at manchester city , and deila would welcome another season - long loan arrangement.
celtic want to keep manchester city defender jason denayer ( left ) on loan for another season hearts captain danny wilson is another defensive target for celtic manager deila but , with jason denayer due to spend pre-season with his parent club in a bid to prove himself , there is no guarantee he will return , and certainly not in time for celtic 's champions league qualifying campaign beginning in mid-july
