the 40 - second - video recorded by haim kaplan at the ngorongoro conservation area in tanzania , shows the driver of a supply truck standing next to his vehicle as a group of baboons approach.
the driver makes an attempt to scare the baboons away but is forced to retreat as one makes a lunge at him the large monkey stands guard as its partner in crime jumps into the back of the truck to search for supplies laughter can be heard from behind the camera as the two monkeys who helped with the distraction scarper.
the man remains good humoured throughout the 40 - second - clip as another man comes around to the back of the truck to survey the situation the man bangs on the side of the truck in an attempt to scare the baboon away and eventually it re-emerges before long the monkey re-emerges and to the surprise of everyone watching carries snacks in both its hands and its mouth
