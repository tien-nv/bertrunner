a 24 - year - old man is in custody after he called for an ambulance , only to have french authorities come and discover weapons , ammunition and evidence of his plans to target churches -- an attack that someone in syria requested , a top prosecutor said wednesday.
the man was identified later as sid ahmed ghlam , french interior minister cazeneuve told television broadcaster tf1.
paris prosecutor molins said sid ahmed ghlam asked for medical help at his home in paris ' 13th district sunday morning , claiming he had accidentally injured himself when he mishandled a weapon.
molins said sid ahmed ghlam was someone suspected of killing a 32 - year - old woman hours earlier and who then intended to launch a larger - scale terror attack in the near future
