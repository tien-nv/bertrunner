cancer survivor gutierrez will trigger a contract extension at newcastle should he start the remaining seven matches of the campaign.
the 31 - year - old was the only newcastle player to emerge with any credit in the wake of last weekend âs 1 - 0 defeat at sunderland.
it was gutierrez âs first start for the magpies in 20 months having twice beaten testicular cancer.
