britain 's five highest - earning nhs dentists are paid average salaries of Â£ 690,000 a year.
the sum is almost five times the prime minister âs Â£ 142,500 pay packet â and comes as thousands of patients struggle to get on the books of nhs practices.
a further 11 dentists were paid between Â£ 400,000 and Â£ 500,000 and a total of 177 received more than Â£ 200,000.
the figures lay bare the huge amounts of taxpayers â money paid to dentists for nhs work , following labour âs introduction of controversial contracts in 2006
