a uk former car mechanic who joined the islamic state as an explosives expert and sniper has shared chilling images of his new high - tech bomb - making factory in syria.
hamayun tariq , a divorced 37 - year - old who was born and raised in dudley in the west midlands , shared four images on twitter of a room where he claims to make devices known as ieds.
components are seen organised on shelves and instruction manuals and bomb - making equipment neatly laid out on work surfaces in the room , which the father - of - two says he hopes will emerge as ' the best electronics lab in the islam state '.
despite already doing the same on his latest account , the militant has been able to share images of his bomb - making factory , where he boastfully claims to spend time ' producing sophisticated ieds '
