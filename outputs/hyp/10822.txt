the lhc ( lhc ) , a particle accelerator and the largest machine in the world , is ready for action following a two - year shutdown.
after problems that delayed the restart in march , scientists at the cern ( cern ) completed final tests , enabling the first beams to start circulating sunday inside the lhc 's 17 mile ( 27 km ) ring.
" operating accelerators for the benefit of the physics community is what cern 's here for , " cern director - general rolf heuer said on the organization 's website.
" the lhc generates up to 600 million particles per second , with a beam circulating for 10 hours , traveling more than 6 billion miles ( more than 10 billion kilometers ) -- the distance from earth to neptune and back again
