labour would introduce a new legal right to â granny leave â to allow working grandparents to take time off to help care for their grandchildren.
the party âs deputy leader harriet harman , in an interview with the daily mail , said grandparents would be allowed to take up to four unpaid weeks off per year in order to help with childcare.
she said the policy , to be unveiled in labour âs women âs manifesto , to be launched today , would require a change in the law and would help millions of working families.
research suggests 1.9 million grandparents have given up a job , reduced their hours , or taken time off work to look after their grandchildren
