spiders on mars may have been predicted by david bowie , but in fact spiders in space could help us get to the red planet.
tether unlimited has revealed a system of robo spiders than can construct solar panels , trusses and other parts of spacecraft in orbit.
the nasa - back firm says it could dramatically reduce the cost of building spacecraft by allowing the final construction to take place in orbit.
' the primary benefit of this on - orbit fabrication capability will be order - of - magnitude improvements in packing efficiency and system mass , which will enable nasa to use small , low - cost launch vehicles to deploy systems dramatically larger than possible with current state - of - the - art technologies
