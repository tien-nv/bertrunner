all of the women are fully veiled , making it hard to identify individuals but it is possible the group may be linked to islamic state.
standing on their parade ground , the radical women are shown shouting jihad slogans and attempting to use their ak 47 rifles.
the radical group of women boisterously shout religious slogans , praising islam and re-iterating their devotion to jihad the women appear to struggle with the weight of their machine guns and make a number of basic rifle mistakes
