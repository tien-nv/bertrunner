a man who complained of headaches found they were caused by an infestation of maggots - which had inadvertently saved him from a deadly infection.
vietnamese labourer lanh , 28 , had a metal plate inserted over his skull after being struck by an iron bar on a building site.
but the botched operation caused his head to become swollen with a potentially deadly infection.
fearing he could n't afford any further medical treatment , mr lanh hoped the resulting headaches would eventually subside
