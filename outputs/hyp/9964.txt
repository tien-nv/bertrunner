the parents of a student who vanished in mysterious circumstances after leaving a nightclub made a desperate appeal for information last night.
karen buckley , 24 , disappeared from the glasgow club in the early hours of sunday morning without collecting her coat after telling friends she was going to the loo.
cctv cameras filmed her talking to a man outside the club before getting into his car and travelling to his flat in nearby kelvindale.
but fears over the irish student âs safety were heightened yesterday after police revealed they had tracked down the man and he is not being treated as a suspect
