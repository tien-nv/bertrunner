i 'm haunted by the video of officer michael slager firing eight shots at walter scott as he fled his encounter with north charleston police -- his back turned to the officer.
what i find more disturbing is how the officer cuffs the fallen walter scott and allows him to die face - down in the dirt while michael slager appears to plant an item next to his body.
as a defense attorney , i am more sensitive than anyone to the assumption of innocence for those accused of a crime , but this single piece of evidence -- a video of a man shot in the back while in full retreat -- defies any reasonable explanation.
however , there is another camera that -- had it been deployed -- might have prevented the entire tragedy : a police body camera
