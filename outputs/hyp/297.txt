so who will be voted player of the year ? eden hazard is the hot favourite but whoever wins will have plenty of tactical voting to thank.
i âm sure eden hazard and the other leading contenders â in my mind david de gea and harry kane â will benefit from their team - mates being careful with who they vote for.
john terry recently revealed he had chosen liverpool midfielder philippe coutinho â who has been very good but not great â as his nomination.
there âs no way john terry can seriously believe philippe coutinho has been better than de gea and harry kane this season ! there is more to it than meets the eye
