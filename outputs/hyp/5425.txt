in 2007 , machu picchu was named a ' new wonder of the world '.
with the ancient inca city featured on bucket lists the world over , visitors queuing up for the perfect photo of its other worldly beauty , it 's not surprising that cracks are starting to show.
since 2011 , the number of average daily number of visitors has far exceeded the daily limit of 2,500 agreed to by peru and unesco.
according to the andean air mail and peruvian times , the idea is to change the ' axis of the visitor experience ' making the mountain into a part of the tourist experience as well as the inca city itself , with the hopes that this can control crowd flow - the project is set to cost around Â£ 28.5million
