tony pulis returned to selhurst park for the first time since he left crystal palace and masterminded a victory which pulled his west brom side to the edge of safety.
alan pardew tried new ideas on the pitch to outwit pulis but an early goal from james morrison and stunner from craig gardner meant he could not deliver a satisfying result against the man who left crystal palace two days before this season kicked off.
despite the timing of his departure , however , there was very little bad blood between crystal palace âs fans and tony pulis who was roundly applauded as he came out from the tunnel in the corner of a ground where the seats are close to the pitch and the crowd can be unforgiving.
