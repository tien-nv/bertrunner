when the earthquake hit , many of nepal 's most renowned pagodas in and around kathmandu crumbled into rubble - covered stumps.
but the kathmandu valley 's other pagodas , stupas and shrines -- also built mostly of red brick hundreds of years ago -- suffered surprisingly little damage and remained standing next to structures which disappeared.
the worst architectural losses have included the majestic shiva temple pagoda and its twin , the narayan temple pagoda , which dominated kathmandu 's main durbar square.
from the late 1960s onwards , western hippy backpackers who traveled the legendary overland route to kathmandu would climb the shiva pagoda 's wide , nine - step plinth , sit in the shade under the triple - layered roofs , smoke hashish and enjoy the lofty view
