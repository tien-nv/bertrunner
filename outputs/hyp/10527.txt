a grand jury in dallas , texas , has decided not to indict two officers in the fatal shooting of harrison , a schizophrenic man whose mother had called police for help getting him to the hospital.
the grand jury 's decision not to indict means officers rogers and hutchins wo n't face criminal prosecution in the case.
but the officers are still facing a wrongful death lawsuit from harrison 's family.
one of the two officers called to the scene tells harrison to drop the tool , a command the officers repeat at least four times as harrison 's mom screams , " jay ! jay ! jay ! " within five seconds of that first command , the 39 - year - old schizophrenic man is shot five times -- including twice in the back as he crashes headlong into the home 's garage door , just a few feet from his mother
