surely a far more useful exercise is to list every aspect of modern life that makes us unhappy.
here âs my list of pet hates â which gets longer by the day : in the face of an increasing number of surveys claiming to reveal what makes us most happy , janet street-porter reveals her list of the things that are making her unhappy - which is getting longer by the day ! trendy men with bushy beards is there anything less attractive than a man âs chin covered by a thick mat of hair ? god forbid you get close enough to snog anyone sprouting a beard that makes them look like a sixties folk singer or an extra from a remake of moses.
secret face - lifts every september , i encounter women whose faces look suspiciously taut , whose saggy chins have vanished and who have managed to eradicate the bags under their eyes.
what âs wrong with a pot of jam on the table ? weather dollies every night these simpering females appear on local tv news bulletins , posing pertly in front of a map of britain in very high heels , and totally inappropriate cocktail frocks , waving perfectly manicured hands around
