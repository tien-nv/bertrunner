a grandfather who could n't afford his own cruiser has come up with an innovative solution - putting his caravan on a boat and taking it out on the water.
thurston , 80 , takes his vessel , dubbed the ' catamavan ' , out on the river swale in kent regularly and enjoys the views of the countryside.
he says his small yachts were too cramped for leisure cruising , and he could n't buy a bigger vessel , so two years ago he built the caravan boat to take his mind off his recent divorce.
bizarre : this ' catamavan ' , a cross between a boat and a caravan , has been spotted on the river swale in kent the catamavan has an oven , fridge freezer , shower , toilet , double bed and two tables , and it is fitted with a small engine that reaches four knots
