an online campaign set up to raise money for a blackpool pensioner who is being sued by the club 's owners has reached its Â£ 20,000 target.
knight , 67 , posted an apology on his facebook account last week to blackpool and the oyston family , who run the fylde coast club , over allegations he made on his social network account last year.
in that statement , addressed to the 34 facebook friends he had at that time , knight said he had agreed to pay damages of Â£ 20,000 to the sky bet championship club , which prompted fellow seasiders supporter joe atherton to set up an account on the website gofundme.com where fans could pledge donations.
blackpool fans vent their disgust at the oyston family before their championship game against reading supporters have been protesting against the oystons before matches and then not attending the games over 1,000 supporters did just that , ensuring the target was met in only three days , and the account will now be kept open to provide more financial aid to fellow supporters such as steven sharpe , who blackpool announced they had taken legal action against in january following posts he made on a forum regarding oyston and the club
