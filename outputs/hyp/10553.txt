i do n't always talk about news events with my daughters , but there was something about the story of espn reporter britt mchenry and the wildly offensive way she spoke to that towing company employee that made me bring it up.
) some of mchenry 's comments , such as how she 's " on television , " imply that she may have the dangerous thinking that she , by dint of her career , education and income , is better than people who do n't get paid what she does or have the same kind of career or educational opportunities.
mchenry showed that she either forgot those " golden rule " lessons from childhood or that she has n't really lived her life with that mantra.
mchenry has since apologized on twitter , saying she said " some insulting and regrettable things , " and that as frustrated as she was during an experience at a towing company in virginia , she should " always choose to be respectful and take the high road
