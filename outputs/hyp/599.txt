mcshane has told his hull team - mates it âs time they woke up and realised they are in a relegation battle.
if hull do go down , and their final fixtures suggest it is a distinct possibility , then this will be among the missed opportunities they regret the most.
what a curious sight to see steve bruce âs players so lethargic , disinterested almost , in the first half against a side with nothing tangible to play for.
mcshane scores against swansea but hull still fell to a 3 - 1 defeat at the liberty stadium on saturday hull defender mcshane is keeping faith that the tigers will avoid relegation despite a tough run of games hull have only scored twice in their last six away games in the league
