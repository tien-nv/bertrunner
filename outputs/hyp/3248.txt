the federal government is looking to take a hard line with parents who choose not to vaccinate their children.
under ground breaking reforms , social services minister scott morrison will reportedly scrap a provision that allows parents who do n't vaccinate their children to claim welfare benefits , including $ 726 from family tax benefit a , $ 7,500 - a - year from childcare rebate and $ 200 - a - week from the childcare benefit scheme.
the way the system works now , children must be immunised to access childcare payments , however , a ' contentious loop hole ' means parents can avoid loosing their benefits by simply signing a form that says they object to immunisation based on ' personal , philosophical or religious ' reasons.
mr scott morrison recently said the rules around welfare payments need to be ' tightened ' and that while immunising children against deadly diseases protects the wider society , it should be a prerequisite to receive tax payer money
