but all that changed thursday when trey asked ellie to be his prom date.
trey -- a star on eastern high school 's basketball team in louisville , kentucky , who 's headed to play college ball next year at ball state -- was originally going to take his girlfriend to eastern 's prom.
trey made the prom - posal ( yes , that 's what they are calling invites to prom these days ) in the gym during ellie 's p.e. class.
trina helson , a teacher at eastern , alerted the school 's newspaper staff to the prom - posal and posted photos of trey and ellie on twitter that have gone viral
