an afghan woman who was forced to marry her rapist and have his baby has revealed how she gave up all of her hopes and dreams to ' buy ' her daughter 's future.
known only by the name gulnaz , the kabul - based woman was only 16 - years - old when she fell pregnant with the child of her depraved attacker asadullah - who is also married to her cousin.
even though a rape led to her pregnancy , gulnaz 's brothers insisted she would not be allowed to return to her ' shamed ' family as she was unmarried and a kabul court sentenced her to two years in prison for ' adultery by force ' , later increased to 12 years following an appeal.
now she is pregnant with his third child but insists she only agreed to marry her rapist so that her first daughter - named smile - could live a shame - free life in the afghan capital 's ' traditional ' society
