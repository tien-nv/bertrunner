sleeping in the arms of their loving parents , these are among more than two dozen babies recently born to surrogate mothers for gay israeli couples who are being airlifted out of nepal to safety.
the infants - some of whom were prematurely born - were evacuated from the country on monday following saturday 's devastating earthquake , which has so far claimed more than 4,600 lives.
several premature babies - and some wounded people - were ferried to an israeli military base on one of the country 's emergency rescue aircraft in the morning.
later in the day , five more infants landed safely in tel aviv with their israeli families
