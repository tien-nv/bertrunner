cuts and wounds in the skin heal in much the same way as a zip being fastened , new microscopic images have revealed.
biologists have studied the healing process at a molecular level using electron microscopes to examine skin as it repairs itself.
they found skin cells appear to attach to each other using tiny tubes that then pull them together so they interlock like a zip.
this image on the left taken of skin cells healing a wound using an electron microscope show how cells on opposing sides ( coloured green and brown ) interlock together in a similar way to a zipper used on clothes
