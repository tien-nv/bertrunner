so what 's changed between the shooting death of brown in ferguson , missouri , in august , and that of scott in north charleston , south carolina , last weekend ? and did the backlash and publicity of the ferguson shooting influence the handling of the north charleston incident ? it 's tough to say for sure , but here are some of the stark differences in the cases , the lessons learned by both police and the public , and concrete changes that could help mend tensions in the future.
ferguson : officer darren wilson said he shot brown after the two struggled over darren wilson 's gun , and witnesses to the shooting had different accounts -- often conflicting -- of where darren wilson was , where brown was and whether brown was surrendering or charging the officer.
north charleston : though it 's unclear what happened in the moments before a bystander began recording the incident on his phone , it 's 100 % clear from the video that scott was not posing a threat to officer slager when the policeman opened fire on scott as he ran away.
takeaway : where brown 's killing was a breeding ground for speculation -- with a stark divide between those who said darren wilson was justified and those who said brown was senselessly slain -- no such debate has emerged in the scott shooting
