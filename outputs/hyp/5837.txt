ashton has been a resident of aneurin bevan court in duffryn , newport for around eight months.
the elderly woman 's son , steve , visits her regularly there where he says his mother is well - looked after by carers who bring her meals.
but after finding the ' terrible ' serving of baked potato and corned beef in a fridge in his mother 's room , mr ashton is calling for more to be done to improve food standards for the elderly in care
