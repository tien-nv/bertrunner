esa âs rosetta spacecraft has survived a hair - raising encounter with comet 67p after the probe ran into difficulties during a recent flyby.
on saturday the spacecraft had dipped to within nine miles ( 14km ) of the surface to take a closer look at the jets that are being ejected from its surface.
but during the manoeuvre , rosetta lost sense of where it was due to the amount of dust and gas and was placed into â safe mode â , causing it to momentarily lose contact with earth.
