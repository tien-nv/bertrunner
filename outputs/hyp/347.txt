the obama administration stepped up its lobbying campaign on capitol hill today to try to persuade lawmakers not to pass any legislation that could hamper prospects for negotiating a final deal with iran to curb its nuclear program.
administration officials as high up the rung as the president himself last week made calls to more than 130 federal lawmakers , urging them to support the deal secretary of state kerry negotiated with iran , and , at the very least , not to meddle in foreign affairs.
the president 's spokesman said a two - week break in congressional activity has meant ' that we have not been able to have as many face - to - face conversations as we would like - but that 's going to change today.
' with the newly returned lawmakers scheduled to tomorrow take the first in a series of votes setting the perimeters for a deal , the white house said administration officials would hold classified briefings with members of congress aimed at ' helping ' them understand ' commitments iran has made so far , and how those commitments we hope will be finalized hopefully in the next two months
