hundreds of staff at the royal courts of justice and lse were evacuated again today after a building due to be demolished collapsed ' like a pancake ' injuring a 56 - year - old workman.
workers underneath the six - storey structure fled for their lives after the fifth , fourth and third floors crashed down on to the rest of the building - sending a huge cloud of dust into the air.
the terrifying incident is just yards from where an underground cable fire ripped through holborn on april 1 bringing parts of central london to a standstill and costing local firms Â£ 40million.
the collapsed building , located just behind the university , was covered in scaffolding when disaster struck shortly after 4pm this afternoon
