an exotic animal owner from ohio is campaigning for his bear and big cats to be returned after they were seized by the state in january.
in total , six tigers , a bear , a lion , a cougar , a black leopard and a liger ( part lion , part tiger ) were taken from kenny hetrick 's stony ridge farm after it was found he did not have the correct permit and cages were ' unsafe '.
authorities have also started cracking down on the owners of wild creatures following an incident in 2011 where a man in eastern ohio released 56 exotic animals - including lions and tigers - then killed himself.
apparently kenny hetrick has been heartbroken by the clampdown on his farm and the 72 - year - old widower is now fighting to overturn the seizure , backed by neighbors who insist his menagerie does n't pose a threat
