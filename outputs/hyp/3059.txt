an enormous diorama which shows the full extent of the waterloo has gone on display to mark the 200th anniversary of the conflict.
the model contains more than 30,000 figures , and illustrates all the key moments of the battle which allowed the wellington to defeat napoleon 's forces.
it was built in the 1970s , but fell into disrepair before being restored to its former glory just in time for the battle 's bicentenary , which falls on june 18 of this year.
despite the enormous scale of the diorama , the number of troops featured is just a third of the true number who were killed or wound in the battle - and less than 10 per cent of the total number who took part
