i spoke to carl froch for an hour this week and we have talked long and hard about what he is going to do next.
needless to say , we were disappointed to see julio cesar chavez jnr lose at the weekend against andrzej fonfara.
it was nât a result we were expecting and it also blows away the chance of carl froch and chavez fighting in las vegas â a fight carl wanted.
i have held talks with golovkin âs manager and there is also the possibility of bernard hopkins , but there are three fights coming up where the winner could work for carl
