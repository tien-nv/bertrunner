neanderthals may have eaten recently deceased friends and family either for food or in bizarre funeral rituals.
this is according to marks found on the fossils of two adults and a child unearthed in the france region of poitou-charentes.
similar marks have been seen at other neanderthal sites showing how our ancestors cut and fractured the bones of their dead relatives.
