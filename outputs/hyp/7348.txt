faced with deplorable conditions at a â horrendous â hotel in cyprus , two lads from cambridge tried to make the most of it by creating a hilarious video diary for their friends back home.
the three - and - a - half minute video , titled â never letting him book a hotel again â , offers a glimpse into every traveller âs nightmare â dirty rooms , antiquated or broken amenities and a swimming pool no one would dare to enter.
with scenes reminiscent of the inbetweeners films , the video was created by patrick miller and his friend , damien , who stayed at the family - run hotel last week when they travelled to the mediterranean island for a friend âs wedding.
patrick miller , from cambridge , ' swims ' in the shallow end of the pool , which does n't have any water the deep end of the swimming pool at the hotel was filled with green sludge , dead insects and debris patrick miller , a self - employed personal trainer , created the amusing video with friend damien rigden patrick miller said in the video , which has thousands of views on facebook and youtube , that he allowed damien to book the room , and they thought they would be staying at a four - star hotel for three nights
