moscow joy womack is taking part in her first ballet class of the day at the kremlin ballet theatre , kicking her legs up to her head , jumping and spinning across the room.
the dancer , raised in california and texas , left her parents and eight brothers and sisters behind when she arrived in russia six years ago , aged 15 , speaking no russia.
when she left the bolshoi ballet academy in 2013 , joy womack joined the kremlin ballet theatre where she still works , aged 20 , as a principal ballerina ; dancing close to the russia president 's office , next to the cathedrals inside the red walls of the kremlin ballet theatre.
the dancer says the amount of money she makes in dollars each month has fallen as the russia ruble has weakened -- the currency has suffered , in part , from a low oil price and international sanctions imposed on russia over its annexation of crimea last year
