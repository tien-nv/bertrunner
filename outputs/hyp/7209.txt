one of the earliest spitfires ever to go into action has gone on sale for Â£ 2.5 million after spending 40 years buried in sand on the french beach it crashed on.
the mark 1 version of reginald mitchell 's famous design was among the first built in march 1940 but spitfire p9374 , once flown by an airman involved in the great escape , never made it to the battle of britain as it crash - landed in may 1940.
the fighter plane , dubbed the ballerina because of its grace in the skies , was being piloted by flying officer cazenove over dunkirk when it was hit by a single bullet from a german dornier bomber.
in 1980 the wreckage was discovered when part of it was spotted poking out from its sandy grave beached : german soldiers sitting on the spitfire p9374 brought down on the wet sands at calais by flying officer cazenove
