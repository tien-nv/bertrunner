attorney general holder bid farewell to the justice department on friday after six years , outlining what he said were his major accomplishments and telling staffers that they helped produce a ' golden age ' in the department 's history.
an emotional holder , who has served as the nation 's top law enforcement official since the start of the obama administration , addressed hundreds of lawyers and staff members one day after his successor , loretta lynch , was confirmed by the senate following a months - long delay.
other clips showed president obama showering holder with praise on the day holder announced his departure.
after loretta lynch , 55 , is sworn in at the justice department on monday , she is likely to continue some of the same agenda as holder as the obama administration draws to a close
