yemen officials said saudi airstrikes targeting a military base on tuesday hit a nearby school , injuring at least a half dozen students.
the information came from two officials with the governor 's office in ibb province , where the school is located , as well as houthi sources from the rebel group that is fighting for control of the country.
a third source , with the education ministry in ibb , said three students had been killed at the al bastain school in maitam , in southwestern yemen , as a result of an airstrike.
the officials from ibb 's governor 's office said the al hamza military base was targeted because houthi have been sending reinforcements from ibb to nearby provinces
