a russian submarine close to the coast of uk may have dragged a trawler violently backwards after snagging in its nets , a fishermen 's organisation has claimed.
the karen was towed at 10 knots during yesterday 's incident 18 miles from ardglass on the south - east shore of northern ireland and the vessel was badly damaged.
ardglass is one of northern ireland 's main fishing ports and local trawlermen are usually more concerned about hitting their quotas than cold war - style intrigue.
