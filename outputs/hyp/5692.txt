a bakery in oregon has been told to pay $ 135,000 to a lesbian couple that it refused to make a wedding cake for two years ago.
an administrative law judge said that sweet cakes by melissa , in the portland suburb of gresham , discriminated against rachel bowman-cryer and her wife laurel and caused them emotional suffering.
melissa klein and her husband aaron refused to make the couple , who held a commitment ceremony in june 2013 , a cake after learning that they were lesbians in january of that year because they disapprove of gay marriage for religious reasons.
the kleins were able to raise more than $ 100,000 from anonymous donors on a fundraising page before it was shut down for violating gofundme 's terms of service
