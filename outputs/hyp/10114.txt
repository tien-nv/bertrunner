the state of oregon on friday released 94,000 emails involving the fiancee of former gov. john kitzhaber , who resigned amid scandal earlier this year over allegations that the former first lady used her relationship with him to land contracts for her business.
the emails show the very active role that cylvia hayes , john kitzhaber 's longtime companion , played in his administration , as well as the tension that it sometimes raised with the governor 's staff.
cylvia hayes routinely attended meetings , was copied on emails among senior staff and requested information or clerical assistance from state employees.
john kitzhaber had downplayed her role in the administration , insisting she was not adviser or public official , which would require her to adhere to the ethics laws that he and his staff must uphold
