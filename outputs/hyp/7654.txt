a remote iron age fort built by the picts as a look out post on top of a 20 - foot - high sea stack has been uncovered on the coast of scottish.

the fort , which was found on top of the dunnicaer sea stack close to stonehaven , aberdeenshire , appears to have been built with stone imported from elsewhere in the country.
