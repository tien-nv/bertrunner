a conservative party candidate has defended photographs which show him trying to lick a female friend 's breasts saying they were taken on a night out with friends and show him being a normal , sociable person.
marshall-ascough is standing to be an mp in stoke-on-trent , which had a 5,500 labour majority in 2010 , and is a traditional labour stronghold.
the candidate , who is gay , is pictured on the open profile of his facebook page appearing to lick a female friend 's breasts.
but mr marshall-ascough has insisted the photos , taken seven years ago , just show him out having fun with close friends ' like a normal person ' and do not undermine his ability to do the job
