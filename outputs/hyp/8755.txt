an astonishing letter from the titanic 's owners to the family of a dead officer asking for a huge sum of money to return his dead body to england has been uncovered 103 years on from the tragedy.
the letter , dated may 7 , 1912 , was sent from white star to christopher , the brother of 24 - year - old officer james moody , who died after the titanic hit an iceberg on its maiden voyage.
in it , company bosses demand Â£ 20 - the equivalent of Â£ 2,000 in today 's money - to return his body to england , and state that christopher will have to pick up the tab from there.
two days later , as the boat was passing through the northern north atlantic ocean , james moody was on night watch when he received a call from one of the lookouts at 11.40pm
