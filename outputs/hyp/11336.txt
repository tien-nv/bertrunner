monday night , as unrest raged across baltimore 's streets , amanda rothschild lay awake in her remington home , a neighborhood in the northern part of the city , thinking about what the next day would be like.
as a co-owner of charmington 's , a cafe in the intersection of three major baltimore neighborhoods , rothschild knew that the cafe and its workers needed to support the city after all the unrest.
as protests erupt nationwide after the death of freddie gray , a black man who suffered a severe spinal cord injury while in police custody , some local businesses in baltimore are banding together to show their support for the city , while others are left to rebuild or repair after monday 's riot.
late monday evening over email , rothschild and other workers from charmington 's decided that the cafe would remain closed on tuesday so that staff members could spend the day in the community to help clean up or peacefully protest
