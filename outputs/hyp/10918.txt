the u.s. has gained much from its position as a space - faring nation.
indeed , u.s. access to space has provided incredible benefit to u.s. national security , defense and the economic well - being of the nation.
unfortunately , as global threats increase and the need for assured space access accelerates , the u.s. is faced with a troubling reality -- we are far too reliant on russia technology to meet our national security obligations.
assured access to space is an area where the u.s. should not be reliant on nonsecure foreign supply chains , which are subject to disruption , threats , unfavorable contracts and undue leverage against the interests of the u.s. the ukraine crisis should have served as a wake - up call , highlighting the danger of dependence on russia to launch national security satellites into space
