a video allegedly showing isis militants destroying a historic city in northern iraqi dating back to the 13th century b.c. using sledgehammers , drills and barrel bombs , has emerged this morning.
isis fighters can be seen hammering and drilling away at sculptures and stone slabs believed to be some 3,000 years old in the ruins of the ancient assyrian city of nimrud , located near the islamic state - controlled city of mosul.
the seven - minute expertly edited video , purportedly shows islamic state destroying the relics before bulldozing and blowing up the ruins , completely obliterating the historic site.
the destruction at nimrud , which took place last month , follows other attacks on cultural heritage sites carried out by the islamic state , which now holds a third of iraqi and neighboring syria in its self - declared caliphate
