everton manager roberto martinez insists he is not worried that lukaku âs new agent will destabilise the player â even though incendiary comments last week look like they were made with that intention.
lukaku was absent injured as phil jagielka âs goal settled this match to give everton a third straight victory.
but the win came in the wake of lukaku âs new agent raiola saying lukaku would never have signed for everton had he been his representative earlier.
â later on , he âll play for one of world âs best teams : psg , manchester city , manchester united or bayern munich , â raiola said , sparking uncertainty over the future of the 21 - year - old belgian , who became everton âs record signing when moving from chelsea for Â£ 28million last summer
