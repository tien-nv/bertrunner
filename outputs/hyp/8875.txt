now , researchers have created a special robo - explorer to borrow into the ice and record the first footage of what lies on the seabed below the ross ice shelf.
the icefin was deployed ( and retrieved ) the vehicle through a 12 - inch diameter hole through 20 meters of ice and another 500 meters of water to the sea floor.
a first - of - its - kind robotic vehicle recently dove to depths never before visited under antartica 's ross ice shelf and brought back video of life on the seafloor.
' we built a vehicle that 's a hybrid between the really small probes and the ocean - going vessels , and we can deploy it through bore holes on antartica , ' said schmidt , an assistant professor in the school of earth and atmospheric sciences at the georgia tech. , and the principle investigator for the icefin project
