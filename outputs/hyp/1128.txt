so when alfie the yorkshire terrier was dumped by thieves 120 miles from his home , he found a novel way to bring about a snappy rescue.
with great presence of mind â or luck â he dashed into a deserted country lane just as an rspca van drove by.
reunited : alfie the yorkshire ( with owner kirsty mitton , right ) - who travelled from wednesbury , west midlands , to buckinghamshire to pick him up after he was rescued the rspca inspector stephanie law ( left ) safe now : the seven - year - old dog ran out of the woods in front of the inspector 's van and started barking the near - miss , plus a lot of barking , made rspca inspector stephanie law pull over.
because the seven - year - old was microchipped , rspca staff were able to trace his owner , kirsty mitton , in wednesbury , west midlands â the opposite end of the m40 from where he was found in gerrards cross , buckinghamshire
