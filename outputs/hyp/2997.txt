students have fallen out of love with the green party , after a dramatic slump in support for their leader natalie bennett , a new poll shows.
on the day the party launches its youth manifesto , a survey reveals only 15 per cent of people at university now say they plan to vote to vote green , down from 28 per cent in february.
after a series of faltering media performances by ms natalie bennett , the proportion of students who dislike her has doubled since september to 24 per cent.
labour has been the main beneficiary , with 35 per cent now saying they will vote for ed miliband , although this has fallen from 46 per cent in september 2013 , according to youthsight
