there was a mild tremor felt in the room when louis van gaal banged a fist on the table to reinforce his point after united had lost 1 - 0 at stamford bridge.
van gaal revealed that he had 11 disappointed faces looking up at him in the dressing room , with the sunken eyes of united 's players pleading with him to explain how they had come to be beaten.
despite united 's defeat there were signs on saturday , what with the slick passing and their range of movement , that the battle lines have been drawn ahead of a proper title race next season.
van gaal 's team are coming for chelsea and this is what english football needs
