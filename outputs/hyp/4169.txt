eye of the beholder by snyder the behaviour of dutchman natural scientist van leeuwenhoek was nothing if not eccentric.
in 1677 , at the age of 41 , he embarked on an extraordinarily gruesome experiment , using his body as a guinea pig.
van leeuwenhoek ( pictured in a portrait ) used his body as a guinea pig in an experiment he took three lice , nestled them among the hairs of his calf , rolled up a tight stocking so that the insects were bound to his leg and then left the stocking on and did not bathe for six days.
while leeuwenhoeck was thus engaged , another great dutchman , vermeer , was intent on his own more genteel studies in his house on the opposite side of delft âs market square
