social media experts say they have found a shocking connection between online traffic in downtown baltimore on monday and activity recorded during last year 's violent protests in ferguson , missouri.
a leading data mining firm , which has asked to remain anonymous because of its government work , claims that between 20 and 50 social media accounts active in baltimore on monday were also used some 825 miles away in ferguson during the peak of last summer 's violence following the death of michael brown.
the firm said the link suggests the presence of ' professional protesters ' or anarchists who are in baltimore and are looking to take advantage of gray 's death to incite more violence.
one account - also linked to the recent union protests in new york city and other disturbances - tweeted photos of gray 's funeral and used language anticipating monday 's violent clashes
