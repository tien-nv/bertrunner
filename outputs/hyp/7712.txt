the militant unite union was facing embarrassment last night over claims it â sacked â an activist for complaining about being hired on a zero - hours contract.
former lecturer martyn reuby won the first round in his legal battle against unite , after a tribunal ruled that he had been employed to teach its courses.
the employment tribunal ruling is a major embarrassment to the union , which has led the campaign against the use of zero - hours contracts , which it says amount to â exploitation â.
ed miliband was left embarrassed today after labour 's biggest backer was accused of employing workers on zero - hours contracts it is also a blow to ed miliband , who has received more than Â£ 13million from unite since becoming leader in 2010
