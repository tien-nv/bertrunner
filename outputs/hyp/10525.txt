washington santorum says he 'd hoped indiana gov. mike pence would veto the " fix " to his state 's religious freedom law rather than limiting its scope.
the law unleashed an intense backlash against indiana , led by tech giants like apple and salesforce and sports organizations like the ncaa , amid concerns it would allow businesses to turn away gay and lesbian customers.
santorum , the former gop senator from pennsylvania , who is likely to mount another presidential campaign in 2016 , said on cbs ' " face the nation " on sunday that mike pence 's decision to sign a follow - up bill -- which made clear the law could n't be used to refuse services based on sexual orientation -- led to a " limited view " of religious freedom.
with the supreme court set to rule in june on whether same - sex marriage should be legalized nationwide , social conservatives like santorum have asserted that christian bakers , florists and wedding photographers should n't be forced to provide their services to same - sex weddings
