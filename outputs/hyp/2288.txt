scientists have used a gecko as inspiration to create super-strong robots that can carry over 100 times their own weight.
the nine - gram robots - built by mechanical engineers at stanford university in california - can haul more than a kilogram up a vertical wall.
another robot created by the scientists - nicknamed î¼tug - weighs just 12 grams and can drag a weight up to 2000 times heavier.
david christensen , a student in the cutkosky lab , compared the robots ' achievements to a human pulling a blue whale
