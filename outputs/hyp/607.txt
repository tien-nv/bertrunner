mourinho might have called it poetic justice as ashley barnes was sent off on the stroke of half - time to deliver a major blow to clarets 's prospects of staying in the premier league.
clarets were left feeling hard - done - by as referee jones denied them a couple of possible penalties and more significantly allowed mirallas to stay on the pitch for a tackle worse than anything ashley barnes did.
all that would be called karma in mourinho 's book.
the chelsea manager condemned the clarets forward for a ' criminal challenge ' on matic at stamford bridge in february when he escaped unpunished and matic was sent off for retaliation
