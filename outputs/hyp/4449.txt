a young man whose former 26 - stone bulk drove him to a suicide attempt has lost more than half his bodyweight and become a ripped gym instructor.
nathan , 21 , from norwich , norfolk , was once dubbed â jabba the hutt â by bullies and became so depressed over his size that he refused to leave his house for a year.
he was just 18 when he took an overdose of 30 pills , but survived , ironically , because he had nât taken enough to defeat his massive frame.
after a year , nathan started using weights to tone his slimmed - down figure , and was so successful he landed himself a job as a personal trainer
