the mother of a two - year - old boy who fell 10 feet into a cheetah enclosure could face child endangerment charges after witnesses claim she was dangling him over the edge.
visitors at cleveland metroparks zoo in ohio heard a scream as the toddler tumbled into the pit at 3pm on saturday.
his parents jumped in and pulled him to safety before paramedics arrived to treat the boy for a leg injury.
though the felines appeared to avoid the child , dr christopher kuhar , executive director at the zoo , said there is a strong chance charges will be pressed on monday
