indiana has seen a ' significant increase ' in the number of cases of hiv more than two weeks into a short - term needle exchange program approved by gov. mike pence , state health officials said on friday.
there are now 120 confirmed hiv cases and 10 preliminary positive cases tied to scott county , about 30 miles north of louisville , kentucky.
health officials who declared an epidemic last month have said they expect the number of cases to rise as more people are tested.
but the growing number could put pressure on mike pence to extend the 30 - day needle exchange program that he approved on march 26
