left his post : army sgt. bergdahl walked away from the army and was captured by the taliban in june of 2009 the former chairman of the joint chiefs admiral mike mullen knew that army sgt. bergdhal deserted his post in 2009 , claim three of the controversial soldier 's comrades.
the men say that mike mullen , who served president obama and then secretary of defense robert gates six years ago , was certain that bergdahl had fled the army and was guilty of desertion.
the claims mean that mike mullen was in a position to tell the president his soldier had run away five years before national security adviser susan rice told the world that bergdahl served honorably.
it also casts a huge shadow over the deal to swap five taliban commanders for bergdahl that culminated in a rose garden ceremony hosted by obama to celebrate his release and attended by his parents
