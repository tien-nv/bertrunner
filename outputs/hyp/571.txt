modern humans have been blamed for killing off the neanderthals by out competing them , breeding with them and even outright murdering them.
but new research suggests it may actually have been infectious diseases carried by our modern ancestors as they migrated out of africa that finished them off.
scientists studying the latest genetic , fossil and archaeological evidence claim that neanderthals suffered from a wide range of diseases that still plague us today.
but anthropologists from cambridge university and oxford brookes university say that new diseases carried by modern humans may have led to the downfall of neanderthals
