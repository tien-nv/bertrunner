bath abbey could be linked to the city 's roman water network to heat the vast medieval church using ancient underground springs.
the idea has been in the pipeline for years , but now excavation work has begun to determine whether it âs possible to connect a modern heating system with an ancient hot spring.
the church of england âs ambitious plans involve harnessing the energy of roman bath âs 45 Â° c spring water to power a modern heating system for the building.
