fifteen buffalo were shot and killed on friday after a day on the loose in new york.
the chase , which took farmers and police officers from five jurisdictions through forests and over the hudson river , ended with " snipers " from the animals ' farm gunning down the buffalo from the side of the road , according to lt. heffernan of the bethlehem police department.
four men from gem farms in schodack , new york , from where the buffalo escaped , were on the scene by a ravine in coeymans , new york , to kill the animals , a decision heffernan said was n't made lightly , but that was necessary.
" twenty - two buffalo escaped from the farm on thursday -- half the farm 's stock -- including six that were shot thursday night in rensselaer county , mesick said
