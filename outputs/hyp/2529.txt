a man who launched an online campaign to help him destroy his brand new $ 49,000 jeep will read out a ' not sorry ' apology to the company on national television tonight.
in june last year , wood raised $ 18,000 online so he and 300 people could destroy his car after jeep refused to pay a full refund for the car or replace the vehicle which he claimed had suffered 21 separate mechanical problems.
during a failed settlement between the manufacturer , fiat chrysler automobiles ' jeep , and mr wood , one of the requests made by the car company was for the disgruntled buyer to publish an ' apology ' in a national publication.
' mr wood launched a kickstarter campaign last year in an effort to raise $ 22,500 - the amount chrysler offered him to buyback the car - and allow donors the chance to be involved in the car 's destruction
