about 20 hours after the boston marathon started monday , many of the cheering crowds had dispersed and the streets were cleared.
venezuelan native maickel melamed , who is battling muscular dystrophy , completed the 26.2 miles just before 5 a.m. tuesday.
a group of energized fans rallied for the 39 - year - old as he walked down boylston street in the pouring rain with volunteers from his foundation , vamos.
maickel melamed is one of about 30,000 participants who raced in this year 's marathon , which comes less than two weeks after a jury found dzhokhar tsarnaev guilty of all 30 charges related to the 2013 boston bombings
