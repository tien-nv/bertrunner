kylie gulliver , a former model and actress ( with appearances on neighbours , offspring and winners and losers on her resume ) from melbourne had been toiling away at her small leather brand for three years , before a very modern encounter - via instagram - changed her fortune.
the 29 - year - old 's brand elliott label is suddenly the hit of hollywood , and is adorning the backs of stars including kourtney kardashian , drew barrymore , diaz and pop group grl.
kylie gulliver admits that since robin antin has come on board the brand has sky rocketed from being a ' small solely - owned start up ' to a complete lifestyle brand that 's reaching a mass market across australian , the us , uk , norway and israel.
robin antin , 50 , initially contacted kylie gulliver to request samples for her pop group , grl , and the rest is history
