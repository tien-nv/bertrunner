dramatic pictures have emerged of a woman being rescued from her car which had become submerged in flood waters following saturday afternoon 's severe storms.
the woman was one of two people that had become trapped in rising waters at zetland in sydney 's inner - east , that was spotted by the same police rescue squad officer on his way to work.
superintendent paul johnston from fire and rescue nsw told daily mail australia that the incident was just one of many flash flooding rescues that emergency services had attended from 4pm.
' at the height of the storm we had two hundred calls in the system , mostly about flooding in people ' homes and businesses , rescues from flash flooding - in the inner city they 're not as dangerous because people are just trapped in their cars and not at risk of being swept away - and automatic fire alarms , ' supt johnston said
