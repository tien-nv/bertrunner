a stray pooch in washington state university has used up at least three of her own after being hit by a car , apparently whacked on the head with a hammer in a misguided mercy killing and then buried in a field -- only to survive.
that 's according to washington state university , where the dog -- a friendly white - and - black bully breed mix now named theia -- has been receiving care at the veterinary teaching hospital.
the veterinary hospital 's good samaritan fund committee awarded some money to help pay for the dog 's treatment , but sara mellado has set up a fundraising page to help meet the remaining cost of the dog 's care
