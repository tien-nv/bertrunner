they are the remnant of a bygone era , when tipu 's ruled one of the world 's oldest empires , living in a forgotten age of opulence and extravagance in indian 's immense palace estates.
but when the duke of wellington 's forces defeated and killed tipu , the tiger of mysore , in 1799 , troops plundered the city and the palace , returning to british with gold , jewellery , arms , armour , clothing and even tipu 's grand throne.
this month , a collection of the historic artefacts from this exotic empire will go on sale at london auction house bonhams , and experts expect them to fetch a total of around Â£ 1million.
pure opulence : a gem - set sword with pink , green and red stones and an ornate tiger 's head pommel is expected to sell for Â£ 80,000
