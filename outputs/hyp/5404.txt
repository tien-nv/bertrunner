tara and gavin hills , from kanata , canada , have been firmly in the anti-vaccination camp , that is until their seven children contracted whooping cough.
at first , mrs hills thought her kids had a bad cold , but then she heard their deep , booming cough that made them gag and vomit - ' the kind of cough that stops a parent 's heart , ' she recalled to national post.
according to kidshealth.org , before a vaccine was developed , whooping cough - also known as pertussis - killed up to 10,000 people in the us annually.
