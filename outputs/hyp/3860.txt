in a retweet on thursday , a staffer to real estate magnate trump managed to capture the coarsest background conversations u.s. are having about former secretary of state hillary clinton 's personal baggage.
' if hillary clinton ca n't satisfy her husband , ' a texas - cowgirl college student tweeted , ' what makes her think she can satisfy u.s. ? ' when someone retweeted the quip two hours later and included trump 's twitter handle in the message , one of the billionaire 's staffers retweeted it for him â to his audience of 2.8 million people.
his office confirmed on friday that it was a trump employee , not a fat - fingered ceo , who was responsible.
hillary clinton 's once - strained relationship with her philandering husband is n't likely to be the stuff of tv ads in the 2016 presidential race , but the tweet suggests an undercurrent of crude jokes are being made at her expense
