noelle velentzas , 28 , could n't understand why u.s. citizens like herself were traveling overseas to wage jihad when they could simply " make history " at home by unleashing terrorist attacks , according to a federal criminal complaint unsealed thursday.
noelle velentzas and her former roommate , 31 - year - old asia siddiqui , were arrested and accused of planning to build an explosive device for attacks in the u.s. , federal prosecutors said.
asia siddiqui is also a u.s. citizen.
asia siddiqui had repeated contact with members of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , published jihad - themed poems in magazines affiliated with the terror group and possessed propane gas tanks along with instructions on turning them into explosive devices , the complaint said
