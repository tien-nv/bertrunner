ten former atlanta public school educators , convicted earlier this month of racketeering in one of the largest u.s. test - cheating scandals , were told to consider plea deals or face significantly more time behind bars.
fulton county judge jerry baxter urged the defendants during the sentencing hearing on monday to accept deals with the prosecution in the trial over a widespread conspiracy to cheat on state tests.
during a trial lasting nearly six months , prosecutors accused the defendants of erasing incorrect answers or instructing students to change their answers so the educators could secure promotions and cash bonuses in the 50,000 - student atlanta school system in 2009.
however , the person accused of benefiting the most from the conspiracy , superintendent beverly hall - who is thought to have received up to $ 500,000 in bonus payouts - died of breast cancer over the course of the trial
