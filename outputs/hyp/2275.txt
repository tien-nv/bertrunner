kenny jackett has told his wolves players they must maintain their focus and follow up victory over nottingham forest with another over leeds united on monday.
the wolves boss believes it is now just the top eight in the sky bet championship who are fighting it out for the play - off places , with their 2 - 1 success at the city ground all but ending the reds ' chances of making a late push.
wolves were fired on by a goal just 30 seconds into the second half from afobe , followed by a bakary sako penalty in the 72nd minute.
dexter blackstock pulled one back for nottingham forest four minutes into injury time , but it was too little , too late
