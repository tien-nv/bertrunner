the grey â stealth â speed traps could be outlawed regardless of which party wins the general election hidden cameras credited with a 25 per cent spike in speeding fines could be banned from motorways within months.
new figures revealed at least 112,000 motorists were given fines or appeared in court for motorway offences last year â a quarter more than in the previous year.
the increase has been put down to the introduction of â smart motorways â which use the cameras , known as hadecs , to police speed limits which are varied according to the driving conditions.
but labour has said if it wins the election , it will issue new guidelines stipulating all motorway speed cameras are yellow and any existing grey ones will be painted
