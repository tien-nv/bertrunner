giant glaciers of ice may be lurking all over mars , hidden from view by dust on the surface.
that âs the surprising conclusion of a study that found that large amounts of ice were not just at the mars poles , but likely towards the equator as well.
it means that , if all ice were to be spread across the surface of mars , the entire planet would be covered in more than 3.3ft ( one metre ).
this image from nasa 's mars reconnaissance orbiter shows that a thick layer of dust on mars covers the glaciers , so they appear as the surface of the ground , but radar measurements show that there are glaciers composed of frozen water underneath the dust the latest research was carried out by scientists at the niels bohr institute at the university of copenhagen and published in the journal geophysical research letters
