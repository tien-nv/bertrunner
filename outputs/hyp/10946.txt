at first blush , rogers and mcguire seem like any other small business owners -- polite , hardworking and passionate about what they do.
she and rogers , 34 , own the breckenridge cannabis club , a recreational marijuana dispensary in the historic and scenic ski town of breckenridge , colorado.
the couple started their business as a medical cannabis dispensary in 2010 , but when colorado became the first state in the nation to allow the sale of recreational marijuana , they saw a once - in - a - lifetime business opportunity.
previously , they were only permitted to sell medical marijuana to the approximate 4,500 permanent residents of breckenridge ; when the new legislation took effect on january 1 , 2014 , they could then sell to any of the 30,000 - plus tourists ( 21 years or older ) who visited the town during peak season
