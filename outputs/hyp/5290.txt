horrifying images of a baby elephant tied to a pole and forced to perform tricks has sparked a push to have it freed , just weeks after one of the endangered animals was ridden by drunken tourists around a swimming pool.
the campaign was kicked off by jaime singleton , who saw the baby elephant , nadia , tied to a pole outside a restaurant at marina phuket resort in december last year.
the change.org petition , titled ' please release nadia the baby elephant to a sanctuary immediately and let her live the life she deserves ! ' , has received 50,627 signatures since it was launched a month ago.
' ms singleton said she has been told by sanctuaries and animal rights workers in the area that the resorts do n't own the elephants themselves , and they instead rely on private contractors who ' rent ' the animals out to different places
