cameron took on church bishops yesterday after they questioned the morality of his austerity and welfare policies.
in an easter message to christians , the prime minister insisted the coalition had spent five years â trying to lift people up â by making work pay and encouraging responsibility.
but much of the 50 - page document was widely interpreted as indirect criticism of the coalition âs welfare policies , which include a Â£ 26,000 - a - year cap on household benefits , a new universal credit designed to ensure people are always better off in work and tough sanctions to prevent people languishing on jobless benefits.
the archbishop of canterbury the most rev justin welby - pictured ahead of a service for the re-burial of richard iii at leicester cathedral last week - has seen the church come under fire from the pm despite evidence that the best - off are paying more in tax than ever before , the bishops also complained that â the greatest burdens of austerity have not been borne by those with the broadest shoulders â
