the new emojis are here ! on thursday , apple released a new version of its mobile operating system that includes more diversity than ever when it comes to the race , ethnicity and sexual orientation of its emojis -- those cute little images that users can insert into text messages or emails when words alone just wo n't cut it.
that shrieking sound you may have heard was from fox news ' megyn kelly , who famously stated in 2013 that santa claus is absolutely , definitely and without a doubt a white guy.
i must admit that being partially of palestinian heritage , it 's heartening to see that despite the fact that some refuse to recognize a palestinian state , apple has chosen to now include a palestinian flag emoji.
of course the bigger question in the whole diverse - emoji issue is : what took apple so long ? how hard could it have been to add different skin colors to pick from ? that the company ( finally ) did is a step in the right direction : america 's demographics are changing , so our representations of who we are -- even representations as tiny as emojis -- should reflect this
