crispin sinclair ( shown with the bike ) is seeking Â£ 50,000 of funding on site indiegogo.
the bike also has foot protectors and an electric motor the babel bike was designed by london - based crispin sinclair - son of the famous british inventor sir clive , whose 1985 sinclair c5 bike turned out to be somewhat of a flop.
