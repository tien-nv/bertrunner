north korean leader kim has backed out of next month 's visit to moscow for world war ii anniversary celebrations , kremlin spokesman peskov said thursday.
" the visit was highly anticipated because it would have marked kim 's first official foreign trip since inheriting the leadership of north korean in late 2011.
he was to have met with russian president vladimir putin as part of the may visit to coincide with victory day , marking the 70th anniversary of the soviet 's victory over germany in world war ii kim also could have had the chance to rub elbows with the heads of about 30 other governments , including the leaders of china , cuba , india , germany , vietnam and venezuela.
and news about kim 's non-visit comes a day after south korean intelligence agents told lawmakers that kim is ruling with an iron fist , having ordered the execution of about 15 senior officials so far this year
