dr oz 's fellow faculty members at columbia have written an op - ed lashing out at how his ' unsubstantiated medicine ... sullies the reputation ' of the university - in just the latest attack on his talk show tactics.
but they also leap to the physician 's defense in the piece , saying that his on - air ' ozisms ' should not cancel out his stellar work at the university , where he has an unblemished record as a doctor.
the eight staff wrote the op - ed for usa today after 10 doctors urged columbia to sever all ties with oz , who serves as vice chairman and professor of surgery at the college of physicians.
those doctors accused him of being a ' charlatan ' who promotes ' quack treatments ' on his syndicated talk show - accusations oz has vehemently fought this week
