in not - so - subtle posts on the social networking site , the two carriers reignited their feud by posting tweets concerning their operation at dublin.
ryanair , run by michael o'leary , shared a photo of two of its staff by an advertising banner in terminal 2 , along with the words : ' low fares have come to @ dublinairport at last.
' ryanair took to twitter for a cheeky promotional photo in terminal 2 in dublin - where aer lingus fly out from in response to ryanair 's post , aer lingus had a dig at where ryanair fly their passengers out too ryanair flies out of terminal 1 at dublin , whereas aer lingus flies from terminal 2 , so it was clear the tweet was a joke at its rival 's expense
