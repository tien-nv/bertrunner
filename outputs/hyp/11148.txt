warren weinstein , who appears to have been the only u.s. citizen held hostage by al qaeda , was accidentally killed in a u.s. drone strike in january.
a senior u.s. official familiar with the handling of the issue told cnn that the u.s. government made no serious effort to negotiate for the 73 - year - old development expert 's release , either directly to al qaeda or through proxies in pakistani.
another senior u.s. official told cnn that warren weinstein 's capture by al qaeda made it hard for the u.s. to negotiate , even though proxies such as the pakistani government have links to intermediaries who might have helped.
a senior pakistani official told cnn that after warren weinstein was kidnapped , the pakistani government put out feelers to members of the militant haqqani network and to the pakistani taliban , which are both allied to al qaeda , to see if these groups might be able to initiate some kind of negotiation about warren weinstein
