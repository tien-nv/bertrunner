once the greatest golfer in the world , but years of bad form and injury have taken their toll on woods and on tuesday he looked grateful just to have the support and adoration of his two young children and longterm girlfriend lindsey vonn.
woods , 39 , was pictured hugging sam , 8 , and charlie , 6 , during the second day of practice at the augusta , georgia , ahead of his latest attempt at a comeback at the masters 2015.
the 14 - time major winner certainly needs all the support he can get after he recently dropped out of the world 's top 100 rankings for the first time since september 1996.
these days woods is dating vonn , herself a four - time world champion and one of the most decorated female skiers in the world
