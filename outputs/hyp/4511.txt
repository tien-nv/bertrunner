patrick bamford wants to lead the line for chelsea in the premier league â but before then he could be leading boro to the top - flight after inspiring this vital victory over wolves.
boro boss karanka said before the game that his team had to win all four of their remaining matches to finish in the top two of a claustrophobic championship.
and thanks to blues loanee bamford â creator of one for vossen and scorer of the other - the teessiders remain on course for what would be a deserved return to the top division.
