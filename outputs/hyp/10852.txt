isis on wednesday released more than 200 yazidis , a minority group whose members were killed , captured and displaced when the sunni islamist terror organization overtook their towns in northern iraq last summer , officials said.
most of those released were women and children ; the rest were ill or elderly , said omar , a commander in the peshmerga force that defends northern iraq 's semi-autonomous kurdish region.
the freed yazidis were received by peshmerga , who sent them to the kurdish regional capital , irbil , said osman , an official with iraq 's kurdistan regional government.
isis previously released scores of other yazidis -- largely children and the elderly -- since attacking the group 's towns last year
