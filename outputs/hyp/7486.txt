a 78 - year - old woman used her own detective work to track down a burglar who had stolen her jewellery during a raid on her home.
anderson searched pawn shops near her house in portsmouth , hampshire , after gold and silver necklaces worth nearly Â£ 400 were taken from her bedroom as she watched television.
the great - grandmother , who lives with husband maurice , 75 , eventually spotted two of the stolen items in the window of a cash and cheque express in the city centre two months after the raid.
her actions , which echo those of agatha christie character miss marple , led to the arrest of burglar campbell , who has now been jailed for three years
