welcome to the exoplanet hd 189733b , where temperatures reach 3,000 Â° c ( 5,400 â° f ) and winds are in excess of 620mph ( 1,000km/h ).
this world might be 63 light - years away - and we ca nât even get a direct image of it - but scientists have incredibly been able to measure its atmosphere , just by measuring its sodium emission.
the findings - made with a relatively small telescope - suggest we may soon have the opportunity to examine other distant worlds beyond the solar system in unprecedented detail.
