protesters opposing the construction of a $ 1.4billion telescope on a mountain in hawaii they consider to be sacred were arrested after blocking a road leading to the site.
police arrested 12 protesters thursday when they tried to block trucks heading to the peak of mauna kea where one of the world 's largest telescopes is being built.
while the hawaiian groups do not oppose the thirty meter telescope itself , they disagree with the location of the construction on mauna kea - the highest point in the state which is considered a home of deities.
and scientists believe the site is ideal location for one of the world 's largest telescopes because of its remote and sheltered position , nestled in the crater of a dormant volcano
