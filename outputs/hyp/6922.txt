former sports minister gerry sutcliffe says new allegations surrounding the bradford fire in 1985 which claimed 56 lives do not justify a new inquiry into the disaster.
a new book claims that the fire at valley parade was just one of at least nine fires at businesses owned by or associated with the club 's then chairman stafford heginbotham , who died in 1995.
gerry sutcliffe , mp for bradford south and deputy leader of bradford city council at the time of the tragedy , says he knew stafford heginbotham ' flew by the seat of his pants ' in terms of the finances of the club but remains convinced by the conclusion of the inquiry by high court judge mr justice popplewell that the fire was an accident.
a memorial to the people who dies in the 1985 fire at valley parade the judge ruled the fire was started by a spectator dropping a cigarette into the rubbish that had accumulated under an old timber stand
