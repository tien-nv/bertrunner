microsoft hopes to lure more people to use its new windows 10 software by making it easy to use many of the same apps they 're already using on apple or android phones.

the company said at its annual build conference on wednesday that it will release new programming tools for software developers to rapidly adapt their apple and android apps to run on devices that use the new windows 10 operating system coming late this year.
