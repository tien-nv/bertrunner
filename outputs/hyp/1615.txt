a chinese entrepreneur has quit his well - paid day job to revive the dying art of chinese sword making.
jia huaijin , 33 , now hand - makes swords in rural chinese that sell for up to Â£ 22,000 each â nearly 18 times the monthly salary of chinese president xi jinping or the average price for a 750 - square - foot flat in shanghai.
mr jia huaijin uses the 2,000 - year - old technique to make the traditional swords , which are highly sought after by international collectors from as far as canada , reports the people 's daily online.
warrior : mr huajin looks like he could have time travelled from the han dynasty hammering away : the molten metal is forged and folded to create the sword red hot : the metal is heated in a furnace before it can be shaped master craftsman : mr huajin is now at home in his workshop , worlds away from his job as a civil servant swords feature prominently in ancient chinese history and the blades made by mr jia huaijin would have been the type used by warriors in the han dynasty
