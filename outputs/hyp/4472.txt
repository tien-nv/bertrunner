nasa has finalised an ambitious mission to send a spacecraft closer to the sun than ever before.
the solar probe plus will carry four experiments into the corona and study the solar wind and energetic particles as they blast off the surface of the star during the closest passes around the sun , temperatures outside the spacecraft will reach nearly 2,500 degrees fahrenheit.
the launch window opens for 20 days starting on july 31 , 2018.
over 24 orbits , the mission will use seven flybys of venus to reduce its distance from the sun. the closest three will be just 3.8 million miles from the surface of the star
