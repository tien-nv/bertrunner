the 17 - year - old albertville , alabama high school junior was proud to be escorted by her grandfather to the annual end - of - year dance this weekend.
webb told daily mail online that she asked her 80 - year - old ' poppa ' drain to prom because he never got to attend the dance himself.
drain dropped out of school after the eighth grade and then enlisted in the navy in 1951 at age 17 - just in time to be shipped off to serve in the korean war.
