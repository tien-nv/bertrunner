spfl clubs are poised to do battle over a late hibs move to cash in on the premiership play - offs.
currently second in the championship , the easter road club stand to make Â£ 1million from anticipated sell - out home gates against rangers and the 11th place club in the premiership - currently motherwell.
under recently passed spfl rules , however , play - off sides must hand over 50 per cent of their play - off profits for distribution among lower league clubs within seven days.
and , faced with the possible loss of substantial sums from two lucrative matches , hibs chairman rod petrie has garnered support from hearts and motherwell for a resolution to slash the profits levied from play - off finalists from 50 per cent to 25 per cent
