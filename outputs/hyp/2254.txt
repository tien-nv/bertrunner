miliband will announce plans for first - time buyers to pay no stamp duty on properties worth up to Â£ 300,000 first - time buyers will pay no stamp duty on properties worth up to Â£ 300,000 and have priority in the sale of new homes under a labour government , miliband will say today.
mr miliband will say labour âs reduction in the rate of stamp duty to zero would benefit nine in ten first - time buyers â saving them up to Â£ 5,000 in tax.
labour claims its tax break â which would last three years â would be funded by a further squeeze on tax avoidance , higher levies on foreign buyers and cuts in tax relief for landlords who fail to keep properties up to standard.
the policy announcements â labour âs most eye - catching so far in the campaign â are designed to counter tory plans to expand help to buy loans , the right to buy for housing - association tenants and to offer 200,000 â starter homes â , sold at a 20 per cent discount
