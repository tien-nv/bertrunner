militants fighting for boko haram in west africa have released the first images of their terror activities since pledging allegiance to isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi.
taken somewhere in the forests of north - eastern nigerian , the images show the jihadis casually posing in front of the terror group 's sinister black and white flag while brandishing assault rifles.
the slick photographs carry all the logos and artwork typically seen in official isis releases , suggesting the middle east - based militants have taken full control of boko haram propaganda.
the release came as nigerian soldiers backed by warplanes invaded the islamist 's final stronghold in the country - the sambisa - in an effort to finally defeat the six - year - old insurgency
