a 30 - year - old scouser released by shrewsbury and tranmere in recent years was the hero of scottish football at the weekend.
full back david raven stabbed home the winner to take inverness caledonian thistle to the scottish cup final.
you can only be pleased for him â he must have thought his career glory had been and gone when he made a few appearances in the liverpool first team as a youngster ( he played in the infamous 1 - 0 defeat for rafa benitez 's reds at burnley in 2005 â djimi traore 's silky back - heeled own goal deciding the game ).
