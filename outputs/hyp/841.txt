the mass stranding of 160 melon - headed whales on two beaches in japan has triggered fears of upcoming earthquake and tsunami.
the whales , which are in fact a species of dolphin , were found washed up along a 6 - mile ( 10km ) stretch of the pacific coast of hokato , around 60 miles ( 100km ) north of tokyo.
although officials are still investigating the cause of the strandings , they triggered rumours on social media of an impending earthquake.
now scientists have filmed the behaviour of wild animals prior to a quake and believe their study could help improve short - term seismic forecasting
