two property developers branded ' arrogant and greedy ' by a judge have been jailed after a three - storey building collapsed trapping three people in the rubble.
a doctor 's wife and a student plunged from the living rooms of their flats into the basement below and a workman was buried after a digger struck a load - bearing column.
the accident left three victims hospitalised with minor injuries , while 20 students were left homeless and one of sheffield 's main arterial roads was closed for a day.
most of the students who lived in flats above the development in the brook hill area of the south yorkshire city were luckily out at the time and missed the accident
