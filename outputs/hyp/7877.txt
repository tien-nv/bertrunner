clegg tonight vowed to block the tories imposing deep welfare cuts as the price of any future coalition deal.
the deputy prime minister said he would not allow the liberal democrats to prop david cameron up in power if he insisted on pushing ahead with his plan to slash Â£ 12billion from the benefits bill.
in an interview on the bbc , mr clegg also suggested he would veto a new deal unless the tories agreed new taxes on the rich.
mr clegg 's remarks come after the defence secretary fallon launched an extraordinary attack on miliband last week
