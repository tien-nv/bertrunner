a father who was caught on camera allegedly punching his three - year - old boy son in the face at a supermarket has launched a bizarre rant online , insisting the incident is a ' misunderstanding '.
whittington , 23 , was arrested on friday in bakersfield , california , and charged with child cruelty after the video of the alleged abuse surfaced online.
but following interviews , his charge was changed from ' cruelty ' to ' endangerment ' , and his bail dropped from $ 1 million to $ 20,000.
on sunday he posted a message on facebook asking for his pregnant wife and son to be ' left out of this ' and was adamant there was more to ' that ' video than meets the eye
