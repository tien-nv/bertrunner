it appears nowadays that it is not an official holiday until you 've uploaded your pictures to instagram with the intention of letting all those at home know how incredible your time away is.
from the food you ate for dinner , to the bags you lovingly packed for the plane , every detail of our ' luxurious ' travels can be documented for social media feeds.
instagram : private planes comes with plenty of legroom and leather interiors , making travel incredible for stars such as justin bieber reality : most of us travel with barely any legroom with hundreds of strangers and possibly screaming babies it is sad to say that flying on a private jet , and on a commercial flight are polar opposite travelling experiences.
while it is still fun to get on a plane , with the promise of a holiday on the other side , seeing instagram pictures from justin bieber 's luxury spacious aircraft could make us wishing we had won the lottery
