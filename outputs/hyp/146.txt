hundreds of passengers on a new york city subway train were evacuated from cars in an underwater tunnel after a fire during the monday morning commute.
a train heading from queens into manhattan was stalled underneath the east river around 8.30am monday morning and its conductor saw smoke coming from the board along the track 's third rail.
they walked through their stalled train into a rescue train and left around 10am part of the train 's contact shoe , which gets power from the third rail , is thought to have touched the board instead of the rail , sparking the incident that left service on the 7 train suspended for just less than two hours
