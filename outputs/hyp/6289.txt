three friends got the fright of their life when they were confronted by a pod of baby killer whales while on a crabbing trip.
steven , joined by friends michael niccum and eugene dight were on an aluminium rowboat when the encounter occurred off the west coast of anderson island , washington.
at a safe distance : the group cheer in excitment as steven captures two orcas swimming and jumping from the water the group on the boat cheer and yell in excitement at what they are witnessing as the whales appear to start moving closer to the boat.
â the group believe that the sound of the rope being pulled along the side of the boat is what attracted the orcas one of the group states that the orca is probably coming to check them out before it emerges from the water and gives them all a fright before later adding : â that is like 50 yards from us , â as the marine mammals continue to head in the direction of their boat
