hadas from eritrea , africa , talks about her experience of being circumcised says she does n't blame her mother for taking her to have the procedure when she was just a baby.
hadas ( not her real name to protect her identity ) , who now lives in the uk , had ' the cut ' in eritrea , where circumcision for girls is widely practiced , when she was just a few months old.
she said : ' in my culture , it is believed that when the vagina is cut , the desire to have sex is cut as well and that sex is only something a woman does with her husband to have children.
' ' most people in eritrea think that if a girl is cut , she will grow up to be a good girl ; that she will not bring shame on her family and she will marry well
