an idyllic two - bedroom log cabin , nestled down a private country lane in the heart of the new forest , has gone on the market for Â£ 350,000.
the 76sq ft hideaway , based near the tiny hants hamlet of newgrounds , near godshill , is made entirely from timber imported from norway.
it has 141,000 acres of forest surrounding the cabin but its ideal location means the cabin is worth more than twice what a similar bolthole would be worth elsewhere.
for the same amount , buyers could own a three - bedroom grade ii - listed former school house just a few miles down the road in ringwood
