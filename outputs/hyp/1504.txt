balls has been accused of treating the public with ' contempt ' after dismissing as a ' joke ' the infamous labour note admitting the party had blown the nation 's finances.
the shadow chancellor said the letter , left in the treasury by the former labour minister liam byrne in 2010 , was just a ' jokey note '.
mr liam byrne 's glib note to his successor as treasury secretary stated : ' dear chief secretary , i 'm afraid there is no money.
but mr ball insisted the note admitting that labour had blown the nation 's finances should not be taken seriously
