an armenian expat who shows australians how to cook a ' real barbecue ' has become an internet sensation after his daughter posted his hilarious video online.
yervand garginian , a 60 - year - old bus driver from south croydon in melbourne , filmed himself cooking chicken on an open charcoal barbecue using a traditional ' khorovats ' recipe at a recent family gathering.
in the video mr yervand garginian , who moved to australians from armenia in 1977 , dismisses the australians - style barbecue of cooking ' oily ' sausages.
his daughter garginian , 24 , posted the video to reddit and it has since been viewed more than five million times after it was shared across facebook , youtube and instagram
