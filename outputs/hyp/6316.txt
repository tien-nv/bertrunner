barry beavis , 48 , lost his case at the court of appeal millions of motorists face spiralling parking fines after judges ruled yesterday that Â£ 85 was not an ' excessively high ' penalty for staying too long in a car park.

mr barry beavis , from chelmsford , essex , had gone to court to fight what he called the ' bullying and threatening ' private car park firms which heavily penalise motorists who overstay in parking spaces
