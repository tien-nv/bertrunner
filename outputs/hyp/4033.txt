it looks like a cross between a catamaran and a hovercraft , but these strange vehicles are actually new new type of aircraft developed in china.
two prototypes of the cyg-11 were tested this week over the sea off the coast of haikou in hainan province in china.
the aircraft is believed to be a joint project between russian and china to build new types of super-efficient seaplane.
the cyg-11 seaplane ( above ) uses reduced drag and increased lift from wing - in - ground effect to glide the vehicles takes advantage of an aerodynamic phenomenon known as the wing - in - ground effect - where lift is increased and drag decreased when an aircraft 's wings are close to the ground
