a former prison officer has claimed staff at one of britain 's toughest jails regularly arrange brutal fights between rival criminals behind bars.
peter hiett , a decorated former prison guard at feltham , said staff would put inmates in a cell padded with mattresses and leave them to fight out any differences.
the 49 - year - old , who worked at the jail for eight years and was commended for bravery , said some workers would even stay and watch the battle unfold , while others ' turned a blind eye to it '.
he also said gangs controlled entire wings at the jail in hounslow , south west london , leaving staff afraid to visit some areas of the prison for fear of being attacked
