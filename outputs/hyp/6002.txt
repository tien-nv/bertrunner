more than 100,000 people on the coast of the pacific northwest are in the path of a potentially deadly tsunami that could be similar to the one in 2011 that ravaged parts of japan.
the new study highlights the areas in washington , oregon and california that would require more time to successfully evacuate for higher ground in the case of the next natural disaster.
it calculated that 94,872 residents and 42,424 employees live within the tsunami hazard zones of the three states.
according to the analysis , 21,562 residents , more than 50 percent of which live in washington , would not have time to evade the tsunami 's waves if they were walking on foot at 2.2 mph
