a gel made from patients ' own blood could help heal burns more quickly - and stop wounds getting worse.
the gel contains platelet - rich plasma ( prp ) - a concentrated mix of substances in the blood that play a role in healing.
it is made by taking a small amount of blood from a patient 's arm ( amounts vary depending on wound size , but typically no more than a couple of tablespoons ) and then processing it in a machine that spins the blood at high speed until it separates into its various components.
blood is largely made up of a clear yellowish liquid , called plasma , but it also contains small , solid compounds - red cells , white cells and platelets
