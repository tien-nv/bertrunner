but in one residential street , a local refuse collector has been exposed as a rogue litterer , dumping plastic bin bags in an alleyway.
his antics were captured on cctv installed by frustrated residents in oldham , manchester , who had noticed the rubbish piling up.
residents confused over who had been dumping bags full of rubbish in an alley next to their street were stunned when cctv revealed a binman rather than load the bags into his lorry , the bin man was filmed lifting them out of dustbins along park road in glodwick before tossing them down an alley.
