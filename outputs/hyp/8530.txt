they will come up against each other in the year 's first major on thursday , but it was n't that long ago that mcilroy was looking up to woods.
the world no 1 - now 103 places above woods in the world rankings - is the favourite to win the masters next week and claim his first green jacket , thus completing a career grand slam.
