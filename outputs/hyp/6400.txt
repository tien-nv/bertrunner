an aviation expert has questioned whether the doomed germanwings passenger plane may had its electronics ' hacked ' before it crashed killing all 150 on board.
the theory has surfaced in a letter to the respected financial times newspaper from aviation boss matt andersson , president of chicago - based indigo aerospace.
