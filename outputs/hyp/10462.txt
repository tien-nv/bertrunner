in the hours after the funeral of gray , a community center and apartment complex that local leaders expected to serve as a catalyst for the rebuilding of a long blighted baltimore neighborhood went up in flames.
the $ 16 million mary harvin transformation center was being built in a part of town where half the properties are vacant buildings or barren lots , where unemployment rates reach 25 % and poverty and despair is rampant.
" disheartened and bewildered " was how the rev. hickman , pastor of baltimore 's southern baptist church , described feeling tuesday as he surveyed the still - smoldering ruins of the centerpiece of a community rebuilding effort led by his church and a coalition of other congregations.
in the works for eight years , the center was to provide behavioral health counseling , support services for people and families with hiv and aids , employment training , home and credit counseling , and ex-offender re-entry services , according to documents filed with the state of maryland
