the oldest human footprints left behind on a muddy lakeside 1.5 million years ago appear to have been made by prehistoric hunting parties.
researchers examining the site where a series of tracks left by a barefooted early human in ileret , northwest kenya , have now found a total of 99 prints.
they now believe that they belong to groups who all passed over the soft mud at the same time - perhaps even stalking some of the other animals whose prints are also preserved in the mud.
the distinct tracks found at ileret in kenya ( like the one above ) are the oldest human footprints in the world it provides some of the strongest evidence yet that the human ancestors that left the prints - homo erectus - were sophisticated hunters
