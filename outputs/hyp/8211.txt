the parents of brown have filed a wrongful - death lawsuit against the city of ferguson over the fatal shooting of their son by a white police officer , a confrontation that sparked a national protest movement.
attorneys for brown 's parents , lesley mcspadden and michael brown sr. , filed the complaint at the st. louis county courthouse on thursday and called a news conference to announce that the case would bring to light new forensic evidence and raise doubts about the police version of events.
the lawsuit is seeking $ 75,000 in compensation , as well as unspecified punitive damages , and calls for a court order prohibiting the use of police techniques ' that demean , disregard , or underserve its african - american population '.
the new lawsuit alleges that officer darren wilson destroyed evidence after he shot brown on the street of the st. louis suburb last august , saying he washed blood off his hands and cleared and bagged the gun used in the shooting
