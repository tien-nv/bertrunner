the good samaritan who pulled a driver from an suv hanging dangerously on the edge of a cliff spoke out for the first time on thursday to describe the rescue that was captured in a heart - stopping photo.
warnock , 29 , was driving wednesday morning in lewiston , idaho when he saw debris near the road and looked up to see a vehicle crashed into a chain - link fence on the edge of a cliff.
warnock chatted with sitko for a few minutes , but left as soon as police arrived because he had to get back to work.
the crash occurred about 8am wednesday in lewiston , at a drop called bryden canyon , shortly after sitko had dropped off his younger siblings at school
