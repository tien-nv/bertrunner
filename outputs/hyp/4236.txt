the london mayor , who appeared alongside mr ed on the bbc 's andrew marr show , launched a furious personal assault on his rival - with their encounter descending into a furious shouting match.
but mr ed , who beat his elder brother david to the labour leadership in 2010 , ended up laughing off the attack , responding : ' come on boris , you 're better than that.
' animated : boris wags a finger at ed , who appears to have a clenched fist , on the andrew marr show this morning
