an entire herd of buffalo has been shot dead by law enforcement in upstate new york after they escaped from a farm.
around 15 animals ran away from their pen in schodack in rensselaer county on thursday evening and then swam across the hudson river.
they then started running down the thruway , a series of toll roads which link up the major cities in the state , including buffalo and new york city.
three men hired by the farm were cleared to open fire friday afternoon in a stream in woods in the town of coeymans , about 10 miles south of the state capital albany
