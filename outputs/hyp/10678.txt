pope francis will visit cuba on his way to the u.s. in september , the vatican said wednesday -- a trip that will come months after he helped negotiate a diplomatic thaw between the two countries.
the exact timing of the cuba trip was n't immediately released , but the vatican said the francis would stop in cuba before his planned late september stops in washington , new york and philadelphia.
" the pope coming here , maybe he could ... make more positive ways for cuba to go towards religion , more than politics , " said raul garcia , a cuban-american who returned to the island.
francis , the first pope from latin america , played a role in restarting diplomatic relations between cuba and the u.s. , earning praise from both u.s. president obama and cuba president raul castro
