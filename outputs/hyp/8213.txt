a woman in her 70s may be forced to sell her childhood home to fund her elderly mother âs care after losing a landmark court case that could have implications for families across britain.
theatre director glen walford has been told by judges that the house , where she has recently invested Â£ 40,000 in renovations , was not her home at the time when her mother went into care because she rents a flat in london.
miss walford , 75 , has spent two years fighting worcestershire county council over whether the Â£ 205,000 house should be used to recover the cost of her mother âs care.
