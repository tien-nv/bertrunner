a 90 - year - old grandmother will not receive the $ 41million jackpot she thought she won at an iowa slot machine after the state supreme court ruled her wining pull was caused by a software error.
mckee thought she hit it big in 2011 when , after putting a penny in the ' miss kitty ' game at the isle hotel in waterloo , the screen announced she had won a bonus award of $ 41,797,550.16.
but on friday the court determined mckee , who has thirteen grandchildren , had actually only won $ 1.85 because of how the symbols had aligned in the game.
the unanimous court ruled that the casino did not have to pay mckee because the game 's rules stated that the maximum award was $ 10,000 and that bonus awards were not allowed
