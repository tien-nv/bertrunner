los angeles former rap mogul knight was ordered thursday to stand trial for murder and other charges stemming from a deadly hit - and - run confrontation on the movie set of the biopic " straight outta compton " earlier this year.
in addition to that ruling , judge ronald coen also lowered knight 's bail to $ 10 million from $ 25 million , a figure that defense lawyers called excessive.
in all , knight will stand trial on one count of murder , one count of attempted murder and one count of hit - and - run , the judge ruled after holding a two - day preliminary hearing this week that ended thursday.
knight suffers diabetes and blot clots , and the case has clearly strained him : he collapsed in court last month after learning of the $ 25 million bail and he was taken to the hospital for treatment
