nigel farage has admitted ukip has ' slipped back a bit ' in the polls as the sense of euphoria among the party 's supporters has waned.
but the ukip leader said he expects to recover momentum in the run - up to next month 's election as its key campaign issues like eu membership are now very much ' back in play ' with voters.
mr nigel farage is also facing a fight to win his own election battle after falling behind the tories in south thanet , kent - despite enjoying a 12 point lead over his tory rival just two months ago.
' we won the europe elections , we found that level and we did have a rally in the autumn through the remarkable events of first clacton and then perhaps more remarkably the rochester by - election ' we 've slipped back a bit since then , there are 30 days to go and i think the issues ukip is campaigning on are back in play
