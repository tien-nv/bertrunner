police in the indian city of malegaon , in the western state of maharashtra , are requiring identity cards for an unusual group of residents : cattle.
following a recent state - wide ban on the sale and consumption of beef , authorities in the city have asked residents to take a ' mugshot ' of their cattle and submit it to the police.
the maharashtra animal preservation bill now includes bans on the killing of bulls and bullocks in its list of non-bailable offenses
