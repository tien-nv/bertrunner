the new horizons spacecraft has taken its first colour image of pluto and its largest moon charon ahead of its arrival in three months.
taken from a distance of 71 million miles ( 115 million km ) , the blurry image does nât reveal a huge amount of detail - but it is a sign of things to come.
as the spacecraft gets closer and closer , the images will continue to improve until it flies by on 14 july - humanity âs first ever visit to pluto.
nearly there : after more than nine years , the new horizons spacecraft is now just three months away from its historic encounter with pluto
