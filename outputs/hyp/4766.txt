there was poetic symmetry in murray 's humbling of kompany at selhurst park on monday night.
ten years ago this month , the crystal palace striker humiliated another of the world 's best defenders , world cup and champions league winner pique.
sure , pique was just 18 at the time and playing for manchester united 's reserves but he , like kompany , is all too aware of murray 's talents after the cumbrian scored a hat - trick against him in carlisle colours.
murray jumps for joy after putting crystal palace 1 - 0 up against manchester city on monday night barcelona and spain defender pique once conceded three against murray in a reserve match in 2005 their careers have taken wholly different paths in the last decade but after a man - of - the - match display which all but ended the premier league champions ' title defence in a match viewed by millions around the world , murray now gets a little taste of the limelight that pique has basked in at barcelona for years
