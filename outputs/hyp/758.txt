two men who became locked inside an airtight bank vault for six hours had to be dramatically rescued by firefighters using heavy drills.
jacob church , 21 , and joe tobin , 29 , were at an art exhibition at a former bank building when the vault door shut behind them , leaving them trapped in total darkness.
the pair - who had only met earlier that night - were fed water through a tube to prevent them becoming dehydrated while police kept in contact with them to check their oxygen levels were not getting dangerously low.
after their six - hour ordeal , eventually fire crews with specialist drills were able to cut through the thick concrete walls
