in true zlatan ibrahimovic style , he was not content with simply breaking the 100 goals barrier for psg on wednesday evening.
the 33 - year - old added another two to make it a hat - trick on the night and take his total tally to 102 goals in less than three years in the french capital.
to put his remarkable goalscoring record at psg into perspective , he now trails only former portugal forward pedro pauleta in the all - time record books.
pedro pauleta scored 109 in 211 games for psg between 2003 and 2008 , zlatan ibrahimovic has played in just 124 games so far
