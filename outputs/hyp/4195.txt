a fashion photographer suffering from cystic fibrosis is revolutionizing the way people look at the life - threatening disorder by snapping the portraits of 56 adult women living with the genetic disease to bring hope to children and teens diagnosed with the condition , which has no known cure.
ian pettigrew , 46 , from ontario , canada , was working on his book of portraits , just breathe : adults with cf , when he realized that he had far more female subjects than male.
after someone noted that the collection of photos was ' turning out to be a bunch of hot chicks with cf ' , he became inspired to start his second project , salty girls , starring women with the disorder , which damages the lungs and digestive system.
' i know what these woman go through on a daily basis ; everyday it 's a struggle living with cf and , to the uninformed , it is the invisible fatal disease , ' he wrote on his website of the upcoming book , which is ' dedicated to showing how beautiful those fighting cf truly are '
