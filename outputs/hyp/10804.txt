the indonesia government has ordered preparations for the execution of 10 inmates on death row , including philippines maid veloso and australian andrew chan and myuran sukumaran.
jakarta has advised consular officials to travel to indonesia 's " execution island " -- nusa kambangan -- where the ten are being held , though a spokesman for the attorney general , spontana , told cnn friday this is not the required 72 - hour notice given to death row convicts before the actual execution.
