will will hatton has n't been able to keep his feet firmly in one place since the age of 18.
the 26 - year - old uk backpacker has only once tried to conform to a regular nine - to - five desk job at a travel agency - an endeavour that failed within six months.
instead , mr will hatton has made a career out of travelling the globe as the broke backpacker , recording his adventures in his blog , making money through any random odd job he can find in foreign lands and spending only $ 100 each week on all of his expenses.
