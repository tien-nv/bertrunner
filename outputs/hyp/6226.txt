the man accused of killing a gay community college worker said the motorcycle he used to get away broke down along interstate 95 and he walked 30 miles before a woman headed to florida gave him a ride , according to a police report released on wednesday.
the woman picked up the 20 - year - old stancil , whose face and neck are covered in dark , self - administered tattoos , some with neo-nazi symbolism.
the woman did n't know he was armed with a knife and had almost $ 500 , the report by volusia county beach safety officers said.
among his self - administered tattoos are the word ' brotherhood ' on his neck and the number ' 88 ' on his left cheek which is linked to neo-nazis stancil pictured with his mother debbie at his graduation
