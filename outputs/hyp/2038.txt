the atmosphere around the club is certainly a world way from the tense finale to the 2013/14 campaign , when arsenal were under extreme pressure in the quest to finally end a near decade wait for silverware as well as finish in the top four of the premier league once again , not to mention the uncertainty around the future of manager arsene wenger.
