working as a warden in rwanda 's volcanoes national park , home to the endangered mountain gorilla , edwin sabuhoro was determined to do whatever was necessary to protect the animals he was committed to defend -- including putting himself in harm 's way.
following a series of incidents in 2004 where wildlife had been lost , edwin sabuhoro volunteered to infiltrate poachers on their own turf by disguising as a potential buyer for a baby gorilla.
" i felt so bad that i had put these people in jail -- but i felt so good that i saved a baby gorilla , " recalls edwin sabuhoro , whose next move was to visit the jailed poachers , as well as their families , to apologize for tricking them and find the reasons behind their actions.
" i thought of an idea of turning poachers to farmers , " says edwin sabuhoro , who took all of his savings -- $ 2,000 -- and divided it to poachers to rent land , buy seeds and start farming
