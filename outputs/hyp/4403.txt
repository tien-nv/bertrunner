blue bell announced friday that it has suspended operations at an oklahoma production facility that officials had previously connected to a foodborne illness linked to the deaths of three people.
last month , the company and health officials said a 3 - ounce cup of ice cream contaminated with listeriosis was traced to a plant in broken arrow , oklahoma.
the recall , the first in the company 's 108 - year history , began when five patients at via christi st. francis hospital in wichita , kansas , became ill with listeriosis while hospitalized at some point from december 2013 to january 2015
