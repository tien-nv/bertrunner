messi , neymar and luis suarez is a star - studded strike force that almost every team in the world would dearly love to have , but when the going gets tough , barcelona turn to jeremy mathieu and pique.
the french centre - back flung himself through the air to reach xavi 's free kick at the back post , heading home from close range , finally breaching celta vigo 's stern defence.
jeremy mathieu ( right ) heads home in the 73rd minute to hand barcelona a 1 - 0 lead against celta vigo celta vigo goalkeeper alvarez conde ( right ) is unable to stop the powerful header from jeremy mathieu celta vigo : alvarez conde , mallo novegil , gustavo cabral , fontas , castro otto , hernandez , fernandez , krohn-dehli ( radoja - 67 ' ) , orellana , larrivey ( dias de oliveira 71 ' ) , duran booked : krohn-dehli , duran sent off : orellana subs not used : mina lorenzo , lopez sanchez , blanco , bongonda , gomez sola barcelona : bravo , alves , pique , jeremy mathieu , adriano correia , rafinha ( xavi ' ) , sergio busquets , iniesta ( pedro 75 ' ) , messi , luis suarez ( rakitic 85 ' ) , neymar subs not used : ter stegen , montoya , bartra , sergi goals : jeremy mathieu 73 ' booked : luis suarez ref : inaki vicandi garrido att : 23,731 this gritty , barely - deserved triumph helped barcelona stay four points ahead of real madrid at the top of la liga , after ancelotti âs side 's almost - harrowing 9 - 1 demolition of granada celta vigo âs aggressive pressing nearly paid dividends , but their hard - work and effort counted for nothing thanks to jeremy mathieu âs goal.
for some reason alvarez , celta vigo 's goalkeeper , is kryptonite for barcelona 's attacking trident , as they also failed to beat him in 90 minutes at the camp nou earlier this season
