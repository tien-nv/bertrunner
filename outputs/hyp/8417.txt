cristiano ronaldo scored his first free - kick in 57 attempts to send madrid on their way to a 3 - 0 victory over eibar.
it was his 38th league goal of the season and with manchester united loanee hernandez scoring a second this was another win that madrid had wrapped up before half time as they continue their pursuit of leaders barcelona.
cristiano ronaldo had not scored a free - kick since last march but when modric was fouled 25 - yards out in a central position midway through the first half , he dipped a free - kick through the eibar wall that bounced just in front of irureta.
