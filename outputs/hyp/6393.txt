women travelling on the tube are being urged to report sexual assaults in a new initiative.
transport for london has launched a campaign to tackle abuse on public transport , with a video in which a female commuter is groped while on the tube.
' would you report it ? ' according to tlc , one in ten londoners have experienced unwanted sexual behaviour on public transport , but 90 per cent of these incidents go unreported.
' the uncomfortable footage - which uses actors - sees the woman hounded by an increasingly persistent male , who looks her up and down , then gets onto the same train carriage as her every time the man steps up his creepy efforts , in this case groping her rear , the narrator - broadchurch actress olivia coleman - asks , ' would you report it ? ' tlc states : ' you do nât have to prove that it was a criminal offence or intentional to report it , we can investigate that for you
