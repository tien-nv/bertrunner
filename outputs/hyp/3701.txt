the football family has rallied round a blackpool pensioner sued by the karl family for alleged defamatory comments made on his facebook page.
knight settled before court proceedings with the owners of the championship âs basement club , having to pay a staggering Â£ 20,000 in damages.
supporters up and down the country have reacted to that by raising close to Â£ 15,000 in under three days â an act of defiance against the running of blackpool.
blackpool fans vent their disgust at the oyston family , who own the club , last week supporters have been protesting against the oystons before matches and then not attending the games knight is a lifelong fan of the seasiders and was ordered to apologise for posting a disparaging status online this time last year
