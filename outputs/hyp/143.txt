sturgeon yesterday vowed to prop up ed miliband in downing street â even if he loses the election.
in her most extraordinary offer yet the nationalist leader called on the labour leader to help her â lock â cameron out of downing street.
miss sturgeon âs latest offer came amid continued fallout from claims she told a french diplomat she wanted cameron to remain as prime minister.
miss sturgeon also denied a separate claim in the memo that mr ed miliband is â not prime minister material â
