two teenage girls were savagely beaten by a crowd of people , including parents and other adults , in a nj park as onlookers videotaped the riot and encouraged the violence to continue.
destiny , 16 , and lajahia , 17 , were brutally kicked , punched , stomped and shoved around by the mob , who can be heard laughing during the five - minute video filmed in trenton.
lajahia said one girl ripped out her earring out before the girl 's mother threw a rock at her ear , leaving a gash that required 12 stitches.
one guy can be heard gleefully screaming ' they gettin ' busy ! ' at one point , according to abc 7 , someone tries to break up the fight but an adult is determined to let it continue , screaming ' let her get her ! ' but perhaps the most disturbing part of the video is when , while destiny is on the ground , her skirt rides up and men proceed to laugh and take pictures , one even exclaiming ' somebody smack that ! ' destiny said she was play fighting with her friend at the park on a nice day during spring break last monday before the riot broke out
