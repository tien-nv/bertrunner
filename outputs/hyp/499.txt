a massive extension of lady thatcher âs landmark right - to - buy housing policy will be announced by david cameron today.
in a bold pitch to blue collar voters who delivered lady thatcher âs three election victories , the prime minister will call the tories â the party of working people â.
he will pledge discounts of up to 70 per cent to allow all 1.3million families in housing association properties to buy their home.
mr david cameron will borrow a phrase used by lady thatcher in her first speech as party leader to declare the â dream of a property - owning democracy is alive â and we will fulfil it â
