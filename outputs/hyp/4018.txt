rescue workers tasked with freeing almost 100 dogs that had been kept locked up in a blacked - out barn in tennessee this week say they were met with fear when approaching the animals , but not their own.
i saw little to no emotion , and when i did see an emotion , i saw fear , ' said haisley , president of animal rescue corps , which led the rescue operation.
the dogs , who had been living in complete darkness , were found last saturday in the barn in manchester ; many emaciated , ' living in several inches of their own waste ' and close to death.
according to huffpost , some had acid burns from the ammonia of their own urine , and there was also a wheelbarrow in the barn filled with 10 dead dogs piled on top of each other and covered in maggots
