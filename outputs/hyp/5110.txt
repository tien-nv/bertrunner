ed miliband 's claim to crackdown on the super-rich unravelled today after it emerged balls has warned the idea of scrapping non-dom rules would cost the country money.
the labour leader used a speech to say he will ' abolish ' the 200 - year - old rule for non-doms , which applies to around 116,000 people , claiming they make uk an ' offshore tax haven for a few ' and can ' no longer be justified '.
but in january mr balls , the shadow chancellor , said : ' i think if you abolished the whole status then probably it ends up costing uk money because there will be some people who will then leave the country.
but mr ed miliband argues that non-dom tests ' are not very rigorous ' and can be granted to people who have a burial plot or property abroad
