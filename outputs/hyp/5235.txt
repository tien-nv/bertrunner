a university of virginia student whose reputation was trashed by rolling stone 's discredited tale of a violent gang rape on campus has taken the magazine to task for not firing anybody after its story fell apart.
jackie , a former friend of supposed victim ' jackie ' , spoke out after he featured in the now - infamous feature a rape on campus , and was painted as a callous social climber who discouraged a rape victim from speaking out.
' i think the rolling stone absolutely should be held accountable ' , he said in a tv interview monday , and added the under - fire magazine has risked its reputation by not disciplining erdley , the reporter who wrote the story.
the most important failing , they said , was not contacting jackie and another student , duffin , who spoke out alongside jackie in an interview with fox news 's megyn kelly
