remember the tuskegee syphilis experiment from the 1930s ? scientists studied poor african - americans in alabama who 'd contracted the venereal disease but did n't tell them they had the disease or do anything to cure them.
a lawsuit filed this week alleges john hopkins and the rockefeller foundation helped conduct a similar study in guatemalans from 1945 to 1956.
orphans , inmates , psychiatric patients and prostitutes were deliberately infected with sexually transmitted diseases to determine what drugs , including penicillin , worked best in stopping the diseases , the lawsuit says.
the subjects of the experiments were n't told they 'd been infected , the lawsuit says , causing some to die and others to pass the disease to their spouses , sexual partners and children
