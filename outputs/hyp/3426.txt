former virginia first lady maureen mcdonnell who has been found guilty of corruption now says she did not receive a fair trial.
her attorneys argued monday in a 101 - page court filing that mrs maureen mcdonnell 's public corruption conviction should be overturned because it was based on an overly broad definition of bribery.
maureen mcdonnell and her husband , former gov. bob mcdonnell , were convicted in a joint trial in september of accepting more than $ 165,000 in gifts and loans from former star scientific inc. ceo williams in exchange for promoting his company 's nutritional supplements.
maureen mcdonnell 's legal team argued that her trial was unfair due a number of mistakes made by the presiding federal district court judge
