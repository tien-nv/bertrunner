paul scholes believes the turning point of united âs season came when angel di maria was sent off against arsenal in fa cup as it allowed louis van gaal to turn to his fringe players.
di maria was sent off in the fa cup tie at old trafford after picking up two yellow cards â one for simulation and one for decent â and forced the united boss to change his starting line - up.
the Â£ 60million signing missed united âs impressive 3 - 0 win over tottenham in which marouane fellaini was one of the stand out players and a result that sparked united âs impressive run of form which has seen them go on and beat liverpool and manchester city in recent weeks.
