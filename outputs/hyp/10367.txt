washington president obama says he is " absolutely committed to making sure " israeli maintains a military advantage over iran.
his comments to the new york times , published on sunday , come amid criticism from israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu of the deal that the u.s. and five other world powers struck with iran.
tehran agreed to halt the country 's nuclear ambitions , and in exchange , western powers would drop sanctions that have hurt the iran 's economy.
obama said he understands and respects benjamin netanyahu 's stance that israeli is particularly vulnerable and does n't " have the luxury of testing these propositions " in the deal
