the first ever mixed race miss japan has lifted the lid on some of the horrific racial abuse she has faced on her way to the top.
ariana miyamoto says it was often punishing growing up as the only black girl in her class in the port town of sasebo near nagasaki , where the us has a naval base and where her african - us father met her japan mother.
the 20 - year - old was born and raised in japan , speaks fluent japan , and was last month chosen to represent her country in the miss universe pageant.
as a youngster ( right ) she grew up in japan some critics of ariana miyamoto 's win have complained she is a mixed race ' hafu ' and not japan enough but the beauty queen had to use her first television appearance after her selection to apologetically explain to reporters that while she does n't ' look japan ' on the outside , on the inside there are ' many japan things about her '
