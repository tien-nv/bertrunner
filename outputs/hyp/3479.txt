the 2013/14 season was seen as a step forward for arsenal , spending the majority of the campaign at the top of the premier league and ending their trophy drought with the fa cup.
arsenal were reeling after a 6 - 0 defeat by chelsea at this stage last season and had 63 points from 31 games the gunners are now in fine form and beat liverpool 4 - 1 on saturday but still have the exact same record the premier league table after arsenal had played 31 games in 2013/14 ( left ) , and now ( right ) played 31 , won 19 , drawn six , lost six - the only stat differentiating the two tables is arsenal 's favourable goal difference in this campaign - a season which their points tally of 63 merits a place of second , rather than fourth
