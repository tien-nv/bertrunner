iran supreme leader ayatollah ayatollah khamenei on thursday demanded that all sanctions on iran be lifted at the same time as any final agreement with world powers on curbing tehran 's nuclear program is reached.
ayatollah khamenei , the islamic republic 's most powerful figure and who has the last say on all state matters , was making his first comments on the interim deal reached last week in the switzerland city of lausanne.
' instant annulment of all sanction is one of the demands of our officials , ' ayatollah khamenei said in a speech broadcast live on state television , ' according to translations published by reuters and the nonprofit foundation for defense of democracies.
' if sanctions removal depends on another process then why [ have ] we started to talk ? ' a senior israeli defense official said in a radio interview after the speech that iran could still obtain a nuclear weapon if sanctions were lifted immediately , and would have more money to spend on arming regional proxies
