according to one female businesswoman in texas , hillary clinton should n't be president because her hormones might make her so irrational she 'll start an unnecessary war.
when george w. bush waged an unnecessary war in iraq -- was his testosterone to blame ? as rios , the ceo of go ape marketing , sees it : " we 're built differently , we have different hormones.
if rios is concerned about hormones impacting decisions in the oval office , she 'd be better off worrying about the male candidates for president.
if science does n't convince you , just google " cheating politicians " for the long and sordid list of men like arnold schwarzenegger , mark sanford and john , whose hormones got the best of them
