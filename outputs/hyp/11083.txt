what would you do if a complete stranger asked you for $ 100 , or offered you an apple in a parking lot without explanation ? these are only two of the 100 challenges chinese - born , us - based jiang put himself up to when he decided to blog about " 100 days of rejection " , a project he launched after he quit his comfortable six - figure job to follow his dreams of being an entrepreneur at the age of 30 , just weeks before his first child was born.
after his tech start - up was declined investment , jiang decided to confront his fear of rejection head - on.
this led to his writing his book called rejection , part self - help and part motivational / autobiography , which is being released this week.
famously , in 2012 on his third day of the project , jiang asked braun , texas , krispy kreme manager ( braun ) to make him five interlinked donuts to mimic the olympic symbol
