graeme dott fears exhaustion will kill off his hopes of winning snooker âs betfred world championship.
the 37 - year - old , a qualifier this year , survived a series of twitches close to the winning line before clinching a 10 - 8 first - round victory over ricky walden at the crucible in sheffield on sunday.
and although ricky walden looked for snookers , his tournament was over once graeme dott dropped in the blue.
graeme dott , who is through to the last 16 , remains aggrieved by having to play three best - of - 19 - frame matches just to get to the main draw
