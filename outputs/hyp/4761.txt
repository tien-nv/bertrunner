arkansas hutchinson gov. hutchinson said wednesday that he wo n't sign a religious freedom bill that his state 's legislature sent to him on tuesday , citing influence from his politically liberal son.
he is sending it back to lawmakers , he told reporters , for amendments that will bring it more in line with the 1993 federal religious freedom restoration act â which critics say better protected the rights of gays and lesbians.
hutchinson said during his press conference that his son had in part convinced him not to sign the bill into law.
' my son seth , signed the petition asking me , dad , the governor , to veto this bill , ' hutchinson said
