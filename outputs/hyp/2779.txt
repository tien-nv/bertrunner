an israel geologist claims he has â confirmed â the existence and authenticity of a tomb belonging to jesus and his son in jerusalem.
after extensive chemical tests , dr shimron says he has linked the james ossuary â a 1st - century chalk box that some believe hold the bones of jesus ' brother â to the long disputed â jesus family tomb â in the city âs talpiot neighbourhood.

dr shimron âs work has renewed controversy over the talpiot tomb , which was discovered in 1980 and dates back to the second temple period and the time of jesus , the jerusalem post reported
