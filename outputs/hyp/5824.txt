bumping into peter in mothercare in palma just over a year ago was not such a big surprise , since we both have houses in majorcan where i now live most of the year.
there we were , two gentlemen in our 70s ; me , a former newspaper editor and peter a well - known businessman , with more than our fair share of silver hair.
we were both pushing a buggy with a tiny baby inside : me , my son ben , now four , who was born when i was 73 ; peter , his daughter rosabella , who arrived when he was 72.
our beautiful and much younger wives ( a 40 - year gap in his case , 25 in mine ) were there too and it was smiles and congratulations all round
