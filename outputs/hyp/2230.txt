one problem with space travel is that humans are nât very good at coping with reduced gravity - their bones and muscles deteriorate over time.
but one company says they have an answer - a giant rotating space cylinder that can create artificial gravity.
their giant cylinder ( shown , with the iss and space shuttles illustrated ) could apparently replace the iss. it would rotate four times per minute to create artificial gravity , and would be 1,300ft ( 400 metres ) long , cost Â£ 200 billion ( $ 300 billion ) and take 30 years to build the â space mushroom â was designed by bill kemp and ted maziejka from united space structures ( uss ) , based in washington , dc , washington , dc the final design would be 330ft ( 100 metres ) in diameter and 1,310ft ( 400 metres ) long.
