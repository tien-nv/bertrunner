a new hiv treatment pioneered using an antibody to attack the virus could lead to a new vaccine to prevent the infection.
the first results to emerge from patient trials reveal the experimental therapy can dramatically reduce the level of virus in a patient 's blood - their viral load.
the scientists behind the discovery believe their findings offer new strategies for fighting or even preventing hiv infection.
the antibody was designed by researchers to block the key viral protein receptor that is needed to infect human blood cells
