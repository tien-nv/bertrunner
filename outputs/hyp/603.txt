david cameron 's manifesto pledge to dramatically extend lady thatcher 's right - to - buy policy was this morning attacked as a ' deeply unfair ' bribe which will cost taxpayers billions of pounds.
in a bold pitch to working class voters , the prime minister said the tories would offer discounts of up to 70 per cent to 1.3million families in housing association properties to buy their home.
but the national housing federation said the subsidy - which will be funded by forcing councils to sell off their most expensive properties - will cost taxpayers Â£ 5.8billion and was effectively worth Â£ 100,000 to each family who benefited.
labour jumped on the remarks this morning , claiming the policy had ' unravelled ' and pointed to figures showing that last year just 479 council homes were sold off â raising Â£ 100million , or 2 per cent of the funds promised by the tories
