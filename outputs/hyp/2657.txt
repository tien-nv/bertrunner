it may be a uk staple but the traditional fish and chips is in peril.
as waters around the uk get warmer , popular species of fish including haddock , plaice and lemon sole could become less common as they migrate to more preferable water temperatures.
researchers have developed a model that combined long - term fisheries data with climate model projections from the met office.
from this they predicted the abundance and distribution of popular fish , such as haddock and plaice , could fall as the north sea warms and this could increase the price of fish and chips in the past 40 years , reports suggest the north sea has warmed four times faster than the global average
