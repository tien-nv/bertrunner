this is the chilling message a mother wrote on facebook a day after allegedly abandoning her quadriplegic 21 - year - old son in the pennsylvania woods with just a blanket and a bible.
' i 'm so happy , ' parler , 41 , commented under a new picture of her cuddling her boyfriend on tuesday.
just 24 hours earlier , police say she wheeled her care - dependent son into a park near their home in south west philadelphia and left him there , before going to stay with her partner in maryland.
relatives , who had been contacted by the boy 's school when he did n't turn up to class on tuesday , commented on parler 's picture , ' nyia call me asap , ' and ' how the hell you happy ? ! ? call me ! ' on sunday police said that parler will be arrested as soon as she is released from hospital herself
