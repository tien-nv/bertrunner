nearly 15 years ago an amazing story emerged of how a young japanese woman had travelled half - way across the world to try and find a suitcase stuffed with $ 1m dollars that had been buried in the snow.
it was claimed that takako had believed the film fargo , fargo was real - after all the hit movie begins with the words ' this is a true story - when she was found dead in a mini-skirt and high - heeled boots in the frozen wastes of minnesota just days after arriving.
this was all confirmed by a police officer from the small town of detroit lakes , who said he had spoken to the 28 - year - old shortly after she turned up.
now takako 's incredible story has been made into a film of its own - kumiko , the treasure hunter - newly released by american filmmakers , and brothers , david and zellner - that dramatizes the myth of her journey and sad end
