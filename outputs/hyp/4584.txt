the mother of a five - year - old girl has told of her heartache each time she looks at her daughter 's disfigured face.
alexis was playing at her sister 's friend 's house in melbourne earlier this year , when a neighbour 's pitbull attacked the little girl.
left with deep gashes of up to 10cm , her mother monique douglas told daily mail australia that not a day goes by that she cries for her daughter who has been left so traumatised that she is unable to play outside by herself.
but what has outraged mrs monique douglas even more is that the dog 's owner escaped without a conviction for not registering his pitbull and was instead handed a $ 1500 fine by the court
