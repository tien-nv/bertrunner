an ohio stadium that hosted rock and roll legends and football games for decades after it was built during the second world war now sits abandoned and in the midst of decay in the northeast corner of the ohio.
the rubber bowl in akron , which hosted acts like the rolling stones , ringo starr , black sabbath , simon and garfunkel , alice cooper , bon jovi , van halen , metallica , tom petty , bob dylan , the grateful dead and aretha franklin , has been basically unused for more than five years.
in addition to serving as a concert venue , the stadium also functioned as the home of the university of akron 's football team , the zips , for more than 65 years.
the university purchased the title to the rubber bowl from the city of akron for the price of $ 1 in 1971
