during an expedition through the brittany region on the west coast of france , photographer le coq noticed an unusual tree.
he positioned himself at the base of the tree and turned his camera upward , filling the frame with the trunk and its spindly branches.
" i 'm kind of a walking photographer , " le coq said.
" this was the start of the photo series " treesome , " an embodiment of le coq 's unique way of interacting with the world around him
