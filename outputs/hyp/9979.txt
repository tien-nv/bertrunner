stuart mccall on sunday night admitted the finest performance of his short ibrox stadium reign left him with â goosebumps â and a growing belief that he can steer revitalised rangers up to the premiership.
on a day which ended with ibrox stadium captain lee mcculloch publicly apologising for a reckless red card , first - half goals from kenny miller and haris vuckic were enough to ensure the captain âs 44th - minute folly did not prevent rangers securing an important three points against championship title winners hearts.
genero zeefuik pulled back a late consolation for robbie neilson âs men but rangers closed out the game to make it three wins in a row as stuart mccall âs improving side leapfrogged hibs into second place with six games remaining.
