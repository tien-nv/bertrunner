it has been a key part school chemistry lessons for more than a century , but now the periodic table may need to be redrawn after scientists found a rare element may be very different from originally thought.
researchers have for the first time been able to test how much energy is required to strip an electron from an atom of the radioactive element lawrencium.
the rare metal currently sits at the very bottom of the periodic table at the end of a group of elements known as the actinides , which sit in a separate block from the main table.
lr , marked as lr on the periodic table above , currently sits in a separate block from the main table if it is redraw , it means that chemistry students could have to relearn the order of how the elements appear
