a 33 - year - old palestinians man says he has been ' duped ' into selling a valuable work created by acclaimed british graffiti artist banksy for less than Â£ 100.
the popular street artist is believed to have ventured into gaza earlier this year , leaving behind four murals - including an image depicting the greek goddess niobe cowering amid the rubble.
that painting , titled ' bomb damage , ' was drawn on the metal door that formed the last remaining part of a two - story house belonging to the dardouna family in northern gaza.
but unaware that banksy 's works are usually valued at hundreds of thousands of pounds , rabie dardouna said he has been tricked into selling the door to a local artist for just Â£ 100
