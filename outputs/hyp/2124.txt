britain 's leading art gallery has uncovered new evidence in its attempt to keep a Â£ 1million constable masterpiece that was looted by the nazis from its jewish owner during the second world war.
britain chiefs believe the chance discovery of an export permit will bolster their claim that the 1824 oil painting â beaching a boat , brighton â was legitimately brought to britain.
the 1946 document bears the signature of a dealer called karola fabri and seeks permission for the transfer of artworks from budapest to zurich , including one by constable identified as fishing boat.
the descendants of hatvany â believed to be two daughters and a grandchild â say the nazis stole the painting and smuggled it out of hungary
