the large hadron collider was restarted today after being turned off for two years during a major renovation project that cost Â£ 100million.
the world 's largest atom - smashing machine is most famous for proving the existence of the higgs boson - but scientists hope it will now unlock even more fundamental secrets of the universe.
physicists at cern , the geneva - based organisation which runs the large hadron collider , are aiming to see dark matter for the first time ever thanks to the device 's upgrade.
it was shut down two years ago - after confirming the discovery of the higgs boson - so that its energy levels could be almost doubled , allowing scientists to carry out more extreme experiments
