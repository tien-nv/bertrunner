a neighbourhood watch official has been handed a restraining order following a bitter row with his neighbours over a garden gate.
married couple john and karen copleston claim phillips , 67 , ' constantly harassed ' them over a petty dispute after they moved a gate at the back of their Â£ 210,000 house in poole , dorset.
retired mr phillips , the treasurer of the local neighbourhood watch scheme , accused the coplestons of putting the garden gate up on communal land and took the matter to council planners.
but on friday the case against mr phillips was dismissed , although a three - year restraining order was imposed on him under the protection from harassment act by magistrates in bournemouth
