it is always revealing to see how players respond to adversity and root has reacted magnificently to being left out of last year âs sydney test.
root showed plenty of grit , as well as talent , in yet another big innings for england root has bounced back from a difficult ashes tour to prove himself as a quality test batsman around four years ago i remember sitting next to thorpe on a bus journey and him quietly telling me that the young english batsman to watch out for was root.
how right thorpe was , for what root has done since sydney speaks volumes about the character of the bloke.
his last five hundreds have been in excess of 149 , four of them have been unbeaten and in the way he batted with jimmy anderson yesterday he showed he has a very good cricket brain
