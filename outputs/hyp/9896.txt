just a day after being released from jail , the man who was beaten by cops following a two - and - a - half hour chase on horseback has spoken out to detail his painful arrest.
helicopter cameras caught a swarm of cops kicking and punching 30 - year - old pusok more than 80 times on thursday , after he fled his southern california home when they tried to arrest him for identity theft charges.
in an interview with nbc on monday , pusok revealed that he had been handcuffed for ' 99 per cent ' of the beating and that near the end of the scarring experience a deputy whispered into his ear ' this is n't over '.
his girlfriend of 13 years , bindner , pictured center when san bernardino county 's deputies arrived at pusok 's house on thursday , he said he fled ' because any contact with police has been negative for me '
