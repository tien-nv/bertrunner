a bizarre new dinosaur with bat - like wings has been discovered by a farmer in china and is now helping to shed new light on the evolution of flight.
palaeontologists in china say the impeccably preserved fossil belongs to a small dinosaur thought to have lived 160 million years ago.
the strange - looking creature had small stiff feathers on its body and long finger - like bones extending from each wrist that were covered in a membrane like a bat âs wing.
the dinosaur may have been able to glide and even flap scientists believe the dinosaur , which they have named yi qi , meaning â strange wing â , may have glided or even flown through the air
