souths hooker luke is at the centre of a homophobic accusation after posting an offensive comment on social media in response to attacks from bulldogs fans.
the 27 - year - old had made a heartfelt appeal on his official instagram account on saturday in a bid to track down the young souths fan who was allegedly attacked at anz stadium in souths.
the rugby league player had intended to donate a jersey ahead of the easter long weekend as a gesture to make up for the incident that left the boy hospitalised after the controversial clash.
but the good samaritan is now under investigation by the nrl integrity unit over an alleged homophobic slur after luke hit back to the taunts , saying : ' get off my page you lil poofters '
