when zayn malik announced he was leaving one direction last week it was amid rumours that he was set to launch a solo career.
and the speculation has not abated since a producer known as naughty boy - real name naughty boy - posted a clip ( which has now been removed ) , of what was thought to have been the 22 - year - old 's first single.
indeed , the track , entitled i wo n't mind , sent both one direction fans and one of zayn malik 's former band mates into turmoil.
while it sounds cryptic , the video is thought to reference the collaboration between the two and angered one direction who are still disappointed at zayn malik 's departure from the group
