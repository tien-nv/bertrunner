lucas and liverpool captain steven gerrard during sunday 's all - star charity game at anfield liverpool midfielder lucas is looking to recapture what he considers his best form in two years after recovering from injury.
the brazil international enjoyed a run of 16 starts in 19 matches from late november - which coincided with a marked improvement in the team 's results - until a groin problem in february 's merseyside derby saw him miss 10 games.
he was an unused substitute in the defeat by manchester united immediately before the international break , their first in the league since mid-december , but played 90 minutes in sunday 's all - star charity game at anfield.
lucas 's return to fitness could not have come at a more opportune moment , with captain steven gerrard suspended for three matches for his sending off against manchester united , and the brazilian is hoping to slot back in seamlessly after injury halted what was turning into a good season personally
