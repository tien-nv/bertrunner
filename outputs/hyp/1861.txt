miliband is in league with the scottish nationalists and preparing to allow them to be â the chain to labour âs wrecking ball â , david cameron will say today.
the prime minister â who last night said he would be a â big failure â if he does not win a commons majority â will unveil an analysis to show labour and the snp are â really on the same side â and want â more borrowing , more debt and more taxes â.
mr david cameron will show that , since mr miliband became labour leader , the snp has trooped through the lobbies with his mps in 91.5 per cent of commons divisions.
warning : david cameron will unveil analysis to show labour and the snp are ' really on thre same side ' today labour and the snp have ruled out a formal coalition but refused to do the same for a looser arrangement that would prop up a minority government led by mr miliband
