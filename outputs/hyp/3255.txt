the old adage that an elephant never forgets appears to be true , based on a touching video showing an asian elephant returning to her mother after years apart.
after a 62 - mile ( 100km ) trek through the thailand jungle , me-bai , the small elephant can be seen nuzzling her mother , mae yui , while the pair joyfully flap their ears and caress each other with their trunks in the elephant nature park sanctuary , in the north of the country.
me-bai was sold to provide rides for tourists in thailand when she was three - and - a - half years old , and did n't see her mother , who also worked in the trade , for three years.
the small elephant left the tourism trade ' because she [ me-bai ] was too young [ and ] began to lose weight and could not carry the tourists any longer , ' according to elephant news ' youtube page
