sherwood has revealed he is still in touch with spurs chairman daniel levy and even thanks the club 's board for ending his time at white hart lane â as the decision has led to him taking over at villa.
daniel levy sacked sherwood as spurs head coach at the end of last season and brought in mauricio pochettino , ending the 46 - year - old 's five - month stay in charge and six - year relationship with the club at development level.
but rather than express bitterness at the split , sherwood , who takes villa to north london on saturday , had nothing but praise for daniel levy , who joined in 2001 , and his former employers.
