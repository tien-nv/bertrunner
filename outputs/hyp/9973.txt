detectives investigating the hatton garden gem heist missed the most crucial cctv footage so far until it was flagged up by a shocked worker more than one week later , it is claimed.
the ' crystal clear ' footage - said to be of a significantly higher quality than the video currently in the public domain - was handed into the met by a worker based 50ft from the crime scene.
the worker had reportedly contacted 101 - the police non-emergency number - on monday last week , believing detectives would already have similar images of the Â£ 60m raid.
it comes after the force was criticised for ignoring an alarm that went off just after midnight on good friday - four days before the raid was discovered
