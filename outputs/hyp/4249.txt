researchers have isolated bacterial dna of several strains of the disease from the bodies of mummies found in the crypt of a church in the city of vã¡c in hungary.
they found 14 different strains of tb bacteria that had infected eight of the bodies in the tomb and traced them all back to a single source.
mummified remains of 28 - year - old terã©zia hausmann ( above ) found in the 18th century crypt of the dominican church in vã¡c , hungary , were among those found to have been infected with tuberculosis by the researchers they say the strains of tb they found all evolved from a single germ that had began infecting people during the late roman period.
professor pallen , a geneticist at university of warwick who led the work , said : ' by showing that historical strains can be accurately mapped to contemporary lineages , we have confirmed the genotypic continuity of an infection that has ravaged the heart of europe since prehistoric times
