two maryland parents whose hands - off ' free - range ' parenting got their children picked up by police yet again on sunday are now vowing to file a lawsuit.
danielle and alexander meitiv have been cited multiple times for allowing their son rafi , 10 , and daughter dvora , 6 , roam free in their suburban neighborhood.
but the meitivs , both of them scientists , say authorities crossed a line over the weekend when they picked up rafi and dvora and held them nearly six hours without food before allowing them to reunite with their parents.
