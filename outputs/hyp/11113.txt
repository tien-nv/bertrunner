job one for newly appointed attorney general lynch is to create a muscular federal response to months of national unrest over controversial police killings like that of freddie gray , 25.
freddie gray 's death last week -- from a spinal cord injury he suffered while in police custody -- has touched off days of protests and rioting in baltimore.
lynch 's job wo n't be easy : as the nation 's top law enforcement officer , she takes the reins of a justice department that has been walking a fine line between nudging local police departments in the direction of better community relations , and threatening legal action against departments where discrimination or brutality are out of control.
lynch will need to put down the carrots , pick up the stick and make clear that the justice department intends to crack down on police abuse by using one of its most potent weapons : the power to withhold federal funds from local departments
