iraq forensic teams have described how they wept as they began to excavate 12 graves , believed to be the final resting place of as many as 1,700 soldiers killed in cold blood by isis last summer.
the teams began the gruesome task of uncovering the bodies of the young army recruits of speicher , slaughtered by the isis militants as they surged across northern iraq for the ' crime ' of being shi'ite.
the deaths showed iraq that islamic state fighters , who have also attacked ethnic and religious minorities as well as fellow sunni muslims opposing them , were a threatening new kind of foe.
today , the first of the 12 mass graves on the banks of the tigris river began to give up their terrible secrets , days after islamic state 's fighters were driven from the city by iraq forces and shi'ite paramilitaries
