sky watchers in western north america are in for a treat : a nearly five - minute total lunar eclipse this morning.
here 's how it 's unfolding : it started at 3:16 a.m. pacific time , when the moon began moving into earth 's shadow.
for the next hour and 45 minutes , that shadow will move across the moon and engulf it at 4:58 a.m. pacific time.
the total eclipse will only last four minutes and 43 seconds , and nasa says that makes it the shortest one of the century
