a man who died in texas of the human version of mad cow disease last year likely contracted it from eating beef raised in britain , a cdc.gov report has revealed.
the unnamed man , who died from variant creutzfeldt-jakob ( vcjd ) disease in may 2014 , just 18 months after he first showed symptoms , was a naturalized u.s. citizen originally from the middle east.
the report concluded the man 's illness resulted from his eating tainted uk beef before he moved to the u.s. in the 1990s.
the extreme rarity of the disease , especially in the u.s. , led the man -- who was in his 40s -- to be misdiagnosed with psychiatric symptoms before ultimately receiving the vcjd death sentence
