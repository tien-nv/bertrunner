this week 's attack on garissa university college is al-shabaab 's fifth major assault in kenya in the past year and a half.
the thursday massacre was the most deadly assault so far , with 147 dead , easily eclipsing the terrorist group 's most notorious attack , a four - day siege in late september 2013 at the westgate mall in nairobi in which 67 people were killed.
after the westgate mall attack , al-shabaab unleashed a string of attacks in kenya that have killed more than 100 people -- assaulting the coastal town of mpeketoni on june 16 , 2014 ; shooting bus passengers who could not recite the quran on november 22 , 2014 ; and then , days later , executing christian quarry laborers.
why is al-shabaab , a somalia nationalist , islamist group affiliated with al qaeda , targeting kenya ? al-shabaab says its attacks are to protest the more than 3,500 kenya soldiers participating in the african union peacekeeping mission in somalia
