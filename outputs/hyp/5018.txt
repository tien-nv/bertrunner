cassandra hann â wrote on qantas âs facebook wall on thursday : â thanks qantas club perth for refusing me entry because i was wearing havianas ( i am going on holidays after all ).
â ms hann fumed : â i had just got off a long flight from sydney to perth with a tired 15 year old and 3 year old and had to wait at perth airport for 3 hours for our connecting flight to learmouth
