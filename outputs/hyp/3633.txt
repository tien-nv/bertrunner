dawn will begin its first science orbit around ceres on 23 april these latest images were taken on 14 and 15 april from a distance of 14,000 miles ( 22,000km ) from the north pole of ceres.
the hubble space telescope has found more than 10 on the surface , but ceres has found that the two most prominent - â spot 5 â - are in a crater about 57 miles ( 92km ) wide.
ceres is thought to have plenty of ice beneath its surface , which could be exposed when a asteroid or comet strikes the surface
