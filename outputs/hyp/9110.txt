what was supposed to be a day spent visiting a famous earthwork sculpture soon turned into a massive rescue effort as 20 strangers joined forces to help rescue a dog out of a tar pit.
with no cell phone reception to call for help , owner george had to leave his dog shelby stuck in a pool by the great salt lake 's spiral jetty and drive an hour out to the nearest town.
but , lucky for george , a family was willing to stay with shelby - and only more and more strangers followed as they heard his story.
tanner , a fox 13 reporter who was supposed to shoot video of the spiral jetty that day , said only shelby 's head was visible from the pit
