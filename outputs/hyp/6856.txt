nicola sturgeon will today launch an extraordinary bid to â lead the uk â as she unveils a string of policies apparently tailor - made for a power - sharing deal with labour.
the snp leader will unveil a manifesto including proposals for uk foreign policy , welfare payments , energy bills and england university tuition fees.
several of her election pledges overlap with labour policy , including slashing tuition fees in england from a maximum of Â£ 9,000 a year to Â£ 6,000 , and rolling back competition in the english nhs.
at the heart of the snp âs manifesto are plans for what miss sturgeon has called â modest â spending increases funded by yet more borrowing â but which in fact total Â£ 180billion over five years
