i have heard the comment â how much longer before broad comes under pressure for his place ? â from a few people in recent times.
there should always be scrutiny on england players â places , i have no problem with that , but we have to be careful we do not get confused between broad the bowler and broad the batsman.
fact is , in the last 14 tests broad has taken 63 wickets at 24 apiece which is pretty good considering he âs been carrying niggles and injuries.
broad ( right ) was dismissed for a duck in england 's first innings against west indies in antigua broad will always give you something different even though he can overdo it at times , and has always had the ability to get something out of a flat pitch
