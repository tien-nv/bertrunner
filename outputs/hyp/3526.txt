a four - year - old boy got trapped in an arcade game after climbing in to the ' claw ' machine when he failed to win a teddy.
henry narrowly failed to pick up a despicable me toy as he played the notoriously difficult claw game at his local swimming pool in tamworth , staffordshire.
desperate to get to his hands on the teddy , he put his hand inside the machine 's hatch - but when he reached too far , he slipped under the trap door and was stuck inside.
she alerted staff at the snowdome leisure centre , but henry was trapped for half an hour as workers looked for the key to the machine
