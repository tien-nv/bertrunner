so it seems you are either with me or firmly against me : there does nât appear to be a middle ground after my comments about tim krul.
it is a week since i criticised newcastle âs goalkeeper for appearing to congratulate jermain defoe at half - time during the wear-tyne after the black cats striker beat him with a brilliant volley.
i have nothing against tim krul , personally or professionally.
newcastle keeper tim krul congratulated black cats striker jermain defoe on his goal at half - time tim krul smiles at jermain defoe shortly after the striker 's goal gave the black cats the lead in the wear-tyne derby sportsmail 's carragher criticised tim krul for his half - time actions while speaking on sky but coming together with an opponent and smiling after he âs scored against you in a match of such importance ? no , i âm sorry
