a young woman has managed to find her doppelgÃ¤nger after launching a campaign on facebook as a social experiment - and their likeness is mind - blowing.
niamh geaney , a 26 - year - old tv presenter from dublin , teamed up with two male friends on a project they dubbed twin strangers to see who could find their closest lookalike within 28 days , and were soon inundated with submissions from all over the world.
incredibly , niamh geaney found her match in karen branigan , 29 , a fellow ireland native who lives just an hour down the road , making it easy for the pair to meet in real life and take some eerily twin - like photos together.
niamh geaney has a brother and two sisters , and both girls agree that none of their siblings look anywhere near as similar to them as they do to one another
