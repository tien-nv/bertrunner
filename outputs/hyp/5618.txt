a teenager diagnosed with a deadly brain tumour has raised $ 80,000 needed upfront to pay for urgent surgery.
jackson byrnes , 18 , has flown from lismore in northern new south wales to sydney to be operated on by renowned neurosurgeon dr charlie teo , the only surgeon in australia willing to perform the risky operation that will likely see jackson byrnes paralysed.
for the past week jackson byrnes 's family and friends have been desperately trying to raise $ 80,000 needed to pay the hospital upfront by tuesday night , so that he can undergo the operation on wednesday morning.
on monday morning they reached the target on their gofundme page , but jackson byrnes 's mother says the family needs an additional $ 45,000 to cover chemotherapy and other hospital fees
