the tv channel e4 will shut down for 12 hours on the day of the general election to encourage more youngsters to vote.
cult us sitcoms like the big bang theory and how i met your mother will be taken off air for 12 hours â with viewers tuning in on 7 may shown instead an advert telling people to go to the polls.
the specially - produced advert will be played , featuring ' darren ' â the man fictionally in charge of keeping e4 on air , sitting in the channel 's control room.
voters aged between 18 - 24 and 25 - 34 are by far the least likely to take part in elections , prompting fears that politicians have given up trying to appeal to their concerns the adverts will ask viewers : ' how many times have you missed life - changing events because you wanted to watch your favourite show ? ' may 7 is election day and darren is going to turn e4 off so you might as well go and vote
