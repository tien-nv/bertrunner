madonna received a barrage of criticism from her gay fanbase today after posting a photograph of former prime minister margaret thatcher and ' thanking ' her for her service.
the 56 - year - old pop star posted the image of the iron lady on instagram - before quickly deleting it just moments later after receiving dozens of abusive messages.
some of her fans took umbrage to the photo , which madonna captioned with : ' thank you margaret thatcher ' followed by ' # unapologetic # rebelheart ' and a love heart.
the singer , who has a large gay fanbase , offended fans who reminded her that margaret thatcher enacted legislation that banned ' promoting ' homosexuality in 1988
