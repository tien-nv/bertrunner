a taxi driver has been ordered to pay compensation to a passenger who was left with severe brain injuries after he jumped out of the moving car.
hicks , now 27 , was on his way home from a night out in bath , somerset , with his girlfriend in a taxi driven by michael young , 56 , five years ago.
mr michael young , a former soldier , had mistakenly believed mr hicks was planning to ' do a runner ' and decided to drive him back to the rank in a bid to teach him a lesson.
but when mr hicks objected , the driver continued on for almost a mile , leading him to jump from the vehicle while it was travelling at more than 20mph
