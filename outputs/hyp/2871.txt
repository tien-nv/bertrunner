new research is suggesting that these extinct early humans may have used wild herbs to flavour their food.
scientists have found traces of compounds found in camomile and yarrow in the hardened plaque of 50,000 year old neanderthals teeth found in el sidron , spain.
neanderthals ( represented in the drawing above ) may have been the world 's first gourmets - using herbs like yarrow and camomile to flavour the meat that dominated their diet , according to a new scientific paper at first researchers thought they might have been using these plants as a form of self - medication , but now new findings have presented a different theory.
animal bones found at sites known to have been inhabited by neanderthals are 90 per cent free of gnaw marks
