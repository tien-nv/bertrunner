alonso , whose youthful brilliance usurped even schumacher in the autumn of his career , considered a life beyond formula one.
this full - blooded driver , who has proved himself probably the best of his generation during 15 dazzling yet sometimes turbulent seasons , said mclaren would be his last team and that when he walks out of the paddock for ever he will barely take a backward glance.
alonso says he will retire from formula one once his deal with mclaren-honda comes to an end â i started with mclaren-honda when i was three years old â a replica from my father ; i will finish with mclaren-honda , but the real one.
â such are mclaren âs difficulties that alonso may finish his career with two titles , a noble haul but fewer than his talents warrant â and fewer than anyone could have imagined when the spaniard , then driving for renault , denied schumacher a record eighth crown in 2006
