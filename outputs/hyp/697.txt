a former high court judge who led the inquiry into the bradford stadium fire which killed 56 football fans has dismissed claims the blaze was not an accident saying they are ' nonsense '.
a new book by author martin fletcher has revealed a series of other blazes at businesses owned by or associated with heginbotham , the club 's chairman at the time of the tragedy in 1985.
the official inquiry into the blaze , led by mr justice oliver , concluded that the fire was an accident , probably caused by a spectator dropping a cigarette into rubbish that had accumulated under an old timber stand at the valley parade ground.
