an eight - year - old girl , who lost her leg in a terrible accident last year , has given her first solo dance performance since she became an amputee eleven months ago - earning a standing ovation for her moving routine.
alissa , from vernal , utah , was only seven - years - old when a truck ran over her foot and immediately severed it.
although the dancer , who has been taking lessons since she was four - years - old , had to have her right leg amputated below the knee , she was determined to get back in the dance studio as soon as possible.
alissa 's mom heather proudly shared a video of her daughter 's performance last month on her youtube channel
