malaysia has passed a controversial terror law aimed at tackling growing support for islamic state extremists in the country in a move opponents denounced as a harsh blow for civil rights.
the prevention of terrorism act - passed in the capital kuala lumpur yesterday - officially enables authorities to detain suspected terrorists for two years without charge or trial.
but it also allows for the authorities to apply for unlimited extensions after those two years expire - something that will be decided by a government - appointed terrorism board , not a judge and jury.
the bill effectively reintroduces the controversial prospect of indefinite detention without trial in malaysia - something prime minister najib razak originally repealed in 2012
