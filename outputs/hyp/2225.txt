history buffs around the world will now be able to access a rarely - seen napoleonic fort for the first time.
the welsh fort , which defended britain from french invasion , will be joined to the mainland thanks to a 328ft footbridge across the sea.
known as st catherine 's island , and home to the historic tower and gun rooms , can currently only be reached by crossing a beach during low tide , which happens for only six hours per day.
a rarely - seen napoleonic fort , off the coast of tenby , will now be accessible via footbridge for the first time but tomorrow , planners are due to approve a new footbridge , which will stretch more than 328 ft ( 100 metres )
