miliband has dismissed claims he would be held to ransom by the snp as prime minister â insisting ' that ai n't going to happen '.
the labour leader insisted snp mps would not be able to dictate policy , even if he fails to win a majority and is reliant on them to stay in number 10.
it comes after the scotland first minister nicola sturgeon this morning said labour could only govern with the support of the snp â and laid out what the party must do to get it.
but speaking to the bbc tonight , mr miliband rejected claims the snp would be ' calling the shots ' if labour did not have a majority
