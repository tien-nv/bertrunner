amelie mauresmo , who is expecting a baby in august , will be replaced by bjorkman in the lead - up to the us open and quite possibly after that , depending on how she assesses her priorities.
the 27 - year - old scot , who is in munich for this week âs bmw open and joined in the 100 - year celebrations at the iphitos tennis club on monday night , parted company with lendl last year because the czech was no longer able to spend half the year travelling.
