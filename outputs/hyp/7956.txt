skyfaring by vanhoenacker , has acquired a morbid flavour since germanwings flight 9525 was deliberately crashed into the french alps by its troubled co-pilot lubitz.
this makes vanhoenacker âs book , unwittingly , very timely indeed.
when he was writing it he had never heard of lubitz , of course , but nor does he dwell on the horrors of 9/11 or any other plane crashes either accidental or premeditated.
vanhoenacker is a senior first officer with british airways , who wants us simply to understand his passion for his job , and to share with us many of its more beguiling secrets
