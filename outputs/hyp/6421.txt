cup hero warren has called for a change to the ' ridiculous ' rule that will see him banned from a second final in successive seasons.
warren picked up his second booking of the competition in sunday 's scottish cup semi-final win over celtic â meaning automatic suspension for the season finale on may 30.
but the central defender , who also missed last year 's league cup final for the same reason , says either the threshold should be raised â or all cards should be wiped from the record for any show - piece final.
