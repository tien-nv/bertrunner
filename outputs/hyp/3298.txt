a couple who spent a lifetime paying off their mortgage have said it was a waste of time after a council scheme to sell neighbouring homes for just Â£ 1 has turned the street into a ' ghetto '.
linda and george hunter , who raised their four children in their home in garrick street , wavertree , liverpool , became mortgage free around 15 years ago.
estate agents say the couple would now struggle to sell their home for much more than Â£ 1 as other houses in the street are being sold off at that price by the council.
mrs hunter , 62 , a retired careworker , told the liverpool echo : ' as the street has become a horrible place to live and my parents died last year we thought " enough is enough " and decided to take the council 's offer and move to a home that was similar in price to ours
