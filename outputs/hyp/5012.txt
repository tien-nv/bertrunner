manchester city 's grip on the premier league title was loosened further after a controversial glenn murray goal put palace on the way to a 2 - 1 victory.
glenn murray fired palace ahead in the first half , despite both he and scott dann appearing to be offside , and jason puncheon crashed in a superb second to deal what looks to be a fatal blow to manchester city 's already slim hopes of retaining their crown.
the fading champions pulled one back through yaya toure but are now nine points adrift of leaders chelsea , having slipped to fourth place.
