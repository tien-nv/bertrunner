i see bolt on the circuit and he âs always good fun.
he likes to make jokes of me ! i remember in moscow , at the last world championships , when i was competing in the 200m when most people saw me as a 100m runner , he killed me in the warmup.
â this is for the 200m runners â the 100m was a few days ago.
gemili says bolt is a joker on the circuit and gives him great advice the young british athlete says he is nowhere near bolt 's standard at the moment but it could be his time soon gemili has announced his participation in the sainsbury 's anniversary games this summer it obviously worked , as i then ran sub- 20 and he was praising me a lot and saying great things about me
