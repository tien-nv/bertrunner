quat'saisons had been on my wish list for a while - and mum is such a huge fan of raymond blanc she once confessed he could be her mastermind subject â¦ nestled in the green rolling hills of the chilterns , quat'saisons is a striking building ; a 15th century manor house built with golden bricks and burgundy roof tiles , and boasting tall chimney stacks and climbing wisteria.
the impeccably kept grounds included perfectly trimmed lawns , bronze sculptures ( including a scarecrow based on blanc himself ) , pathways lined with lavender and the walled organic kitchen garden - which supplies the restaurant with seasonal herbs , salads and vegetables.
