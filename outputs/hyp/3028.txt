the arrival of an advanced group of modern humans in europe 40,000 years ago played a role in the demise of neanderthals , scientists have claimed.
neanderthals were the dominant human species in europe and much of asia for around 250,000 years before vanishing entirely 41,000 years ago.
now scientists have found proof that a group of modern humans known as the protoaurignacian culture arrived in southern europe at around the same time the neanderthals disappeared.
scientists took ct scans of teeth found at riparo bombrini in western ligurian alps ( left ) and in the grotta di fumane in western lessini mountains ( right ) , both in italy , and found they belonged to ancestors of modern humans who were part of a group known as the protoaurignacian culture they have been able to conclusively show that a pair of ancient baby teeth found at two prehistoric sites in northern italy belong to modern humans from this culture
