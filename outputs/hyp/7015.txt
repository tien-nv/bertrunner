an ohio police officer who jumped on the hood of a car and fired the final 15 rounds of a 137 - shot barrage that killed a pair of unarmed suspects is claiming that he does n't remember doing it.
brelo goes on trial on monday charged with two counts of voluntary manslaughter for the deaths of timothy russell , 43 , and malissa williams , 30.
he is the lone officer among the 13 who fired their weapons that night who is charged criminally because prosecutors say he stood on the hood and opened fire four seconds after the other officers had stopped shooting.
a rookie cop told the same investigators brelo spoke with that the 31 - year - old cleveland officer talked about it in the days after the november 2012 shooting
