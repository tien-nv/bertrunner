a year ago bloomberg published a story with the following headline : pence , a koch , mulls 2016 run for president.
the story ticked off items on pence 's conservative things - to - do list while also noting his close ties to the deep - pocketed koch brothers , as well as other right - wing lobbying groups.
last august the indiana governor was in dallas for an americans for prosperity event ; the group is backed by the conservative koch brothers , and supported gov. pence 's tax - slashing budget.
why would pence ignore the pleas of indiana 's chamber of commerce as well as the gop mayor of his state capital and sign such a bill ? because there 's a very powerful wing of his party that wants a conservative as its 2016 candidate and this bill was pence 's way of shoring up his street cred
