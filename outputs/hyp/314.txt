man utd 's humiliation of their noisy neighbours city at old trafford led the club 's official website to claim the city was turned red once more in the space of 90 minutes.
yet was this the case ? was that 4 - 2 win a sign that man utd are the dominant force in manchester again , or should we just chalk it off as nothing more than a bad game for the defending champions ? city had , after all , beaten man utd four consecutive times going into the derby , so should the red half of manchester be so confident sitting four points ahead ? here is sportsmail 's verdict on the issues.
pellegrini and his players began this season with aspirations of defending their premier league title and making an impact on the champions league.
man utd 's players celebrate together during the derby win for the red half of the city mata salutes the old trafford crowd while young and rooney celebrate his goal with man utd setting their own sights no higher than a return to the top four , the club from the other side of town were the least of their worries
