smartphones often overheat if they 're held close to the body or are used for long periods of time.
and while the dangers of overheating lithium ion ( li-ion batteries ) batteries have been known for some time , researchers have now revealed exactly what happens inside the ' burning ' cells.
thermal images show copper inside the battery reaching temperatures of at least 1,085 Â° c ( 1,985 â° f ) causing jets of molten material to burst from its vent.
