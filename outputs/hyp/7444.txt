an international panel of scientists will today launch a major inquiry to discover whether official world temperature records have exaggerated the extent of global warming.
the panel , convened by the global warming policy foundation ( global warming policy foundation ) , the â climate sceptic â think - tank led by the former tory chancellor lord lawson , will focus on thousands of â adjustments â that have been made to temperature records kept at individual weather stations around the world.
sceptics have argued that the effect of such adjustments â made when instruments are replaced or recalibrated , or heat - producing buildings are erected close to weather station sites â has skewed the records.
sceptics : the panel will look at whether ' adjustments ' made to temperature records around the world have made climate change appear worse - or whether they actually manage to cancel each other out the panel will also examine â extrapolations â â when the records include virtual figures from places where there is no actual measuring station , instead basing them on the figures of other stations in the same region
