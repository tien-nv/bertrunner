a columbia student who was accused of rape is suing the new york city school for allowing his accuser to publicly brand him a " serial rapist " according to the lawsuit , paul nungesser was cleared of responsibility in sulkowicz 's 2013 rape claim , as well as others that came to light after sulkowicz went public with her allegations in various media interviews.
her case drew national attention after she started carrying a mattress around campus to protest the school 's handling of the complaint , saying she hoped to show how " flawed " the university disciplinary system is when it comes to sexual misconduct cases.
paul nungesser , an international student from germany , filed a federal discrimination lawsuit last week against the school ; its president , bollinger ; and the visual arts professor who oversaw sulkowicz 's mattress project , " carry that weight , " as part of her senior thesis.
the lawsuit alleges the defendants violated paul nungesser 's right to an education free of gender - based discrimination by allowing sulkowicz to speak out against him after he had been cleared of wrongdoing
