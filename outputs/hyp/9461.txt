garnet has been abandoned for almost 100 years.
the tiny montana outpost was established in the 1860s by miners looking for gold and silver , but it was devastated by fire around 1912 and deserted a few years later.
while the town has since been restored , it remains empty , and local folklore says the area is haunted by former residents , with visitors saying they heard music and laughter , even in winter , and the sound of doors slamming in cottages where there are n't any doors.
now the u.s. blm is offering free food , housing a job to people willing to live in garnet and work as a tour operator , as the government prepares the village to become a new tourist stop
