one of tokyo 's most prominent districts has taken a small , but potentially significant step to recognizing same - sex unions in japanese.
the government of shibuya ward , one of the capital 's most famous shopping and trendy entertainment districts , passed ordinance on wednesday paving the way for " partnership certificates " for same - sex couples , allowing them some of the rights of married heterosexual couples.
while the certificates will not be issued until later in the summer and are not legally binding , proponents of marriage equality in socially conservative japanese say that the ward 's decision is a step in the right direction.
while shibuya 's decision does not yet equate to heterosexual marriage , the hope is that the move will be the beginnings of promoting marriage equality for gay communities
