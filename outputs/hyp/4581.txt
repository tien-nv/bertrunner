hungry for power : snp leader sturgeon snp leader sturgeon last night admitted she understands concerns of english voters about her party being involved in a coalition government.
â she also suggested that david cameron had been â not unhelpful â to the snp by gaining the party greater publicity.
â the message it âs given to people in scotland is â if this is the attention we get just from the snp riding high in the polls , imagine how loud our voice would be if that was translated into seats.
â miss sturgeon âs remarks came after she had insisted that she would put ed miliband into downing street even if labour wins 40 fewer seats than the tories in a hung parliament
