the bbc has axed richard hammond and james may from the top gear website after co-presenter jeremy clarkson was sacked from the show.
the motoring programme 's website previously featured the broadcasting trio alongside the stig at the top of the page but now the racing driver appears solo in his white helmet.
it comes just over a week after the 54 - year - old host was sacked from the bbc for an ' unprovoked ' attack on a top gear producer.
the bbc say the website change is to reflect the fact that none of the presenters are currently in contract together the 12 bikes are estimated to be worth a guide price of Â£ 66,000 and are being sold off by auctioneers bonhams later this month
