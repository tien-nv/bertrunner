we have had cereal cafes , a porridge pop - up and a toastie restaurant so it should come as no surprise that london is about to get yet another single - item menu eaterie.
the latest to open in the capital this week is the oshun cafã© , which will serve Â£ 6 bowls of brazilian superfood acai berries.
courgette , lime , sour cherries and strawberries in the oshun tang ( right ) the fruit bowls include oshun native made with acaÃ­ pulp , banana and honey ; the oshun tang made with courgette , lime , sour cherries and acai pulp ; the oshun kong featuring acaÃ­ pulp , banana , lemongrass , ginger , coriander and honey ; and the oshun maya with acaÃ­ pulp , raw cacao , cinnamon , orange and avocado.
liane holey , founder of the cafe said : â brazilian âs streets are filled with vendors blending acaÃ­ pulp with fresh bananas and then topped with honey and granola to create an innocuously addictive berry bowl
