those lucky enough to snag a ticket to the star - studded â on and off the stage - coachella at the empire polo club in indio , californian , which runs for its second weekend from april 17 - 19 , are spending more than any other major festival goers.
while checking out headliners such as ac / dc , jack white , florence and the machine and madonna , who bizarrely made out with rapper drake on sunday , coachella visitors pay an average of Â£ 187 per day according to travel money specialist no.1 currency.
if they indeed are required to reach into their own wallets , the likes of alessandra ambrosio and brooklyn beckham pay the highest - priced admission ( Â£ 252 ) , beer ( Â£ 5.73 ) and meal costs ( Â£ 9 ) of any summer fest. tomorrowland , which this year features club superstars carl cox , david guetta and avicii when it âs held on july 25 , costs its visitors Â£ 186 per day.
england âs glastonbury , running june 24 to 28 and featuring foo fighters in 2015 , is the third most expensive with a Â£ 113 per day cost calculated from the five - day Â£ 565 ticket and an estimated average of Â£ 68 per day for meals and drinks
