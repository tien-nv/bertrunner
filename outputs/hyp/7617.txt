one of the three london schoolgirls who left the uk to become ' jihadi brides ' in syria has confirmed that she is now living in the islamic state - by tweeting a picture of chicken and chips.
amira , 15 , left bethnal green with shamima begum 15 , and kadiza sultana , 16 , in february , and is believed to be living in the syria city of raqqa.
now , nearly two months after her departure , amira has shared a snippet of life in the islamic state - posting an online photo of her enjoying a takeaway dinner with another teenage ' jihadi bride '.
amira , pictured last september , has tweeted from inside the islamic state for the first time disturbing minds : amira uses the same twitter picture as another western teen runaway , known only as um ayoub , who tweeted earlier this year that she wanted to ' behead some kafirs [ non-muslims ] now '
