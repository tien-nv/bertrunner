leeds have sent full back hardaker on an anger management course after a student was left with two black eyes and bruising during a violent incident in february.
hardaker was at the centre of a police assault probe into an attack on a 22 - year - old man at student flats in leeds , but was not charged with any offence.
leeds issued a lengthy statement outlining hardaker 's punishment , which will also see him forfeit one month 's salary to be donated to a local charity and do up to 20 hours a week of voluntary work for the club 's foundation for the duration of his contract.
hardaker and team - mate elliot minchella both paid Â£ 200 in compensation and wrote a letter of apology to a 22 - year - old man following a police investigation but leeds said hardaker 's punishment is far stronger ' given his previous misconduct '
