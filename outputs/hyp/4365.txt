sexting is ' not advised for politicians ' , says ed miliband - and ' risky if you are young , dodgy if you are older ' in the words of deputy prime minister nick clegg.
both men were asked their opinion on the practice of sending sexy text messages in a quiz for fashion magazine cosmopolitan 's website.
and education secretary nicky morgan answered : ' a bit too risky , thank you very much ! ' the verdict : politicians should not sext , says ed miliband ( right ) and deputy prime minister nick clegg ( left ) says it is ' risky ' for youngsters and ' dodgy ' if you are older their responses are hardly surprisingly considering the downfalls of fellow politicians when salacious messages are revealed in the press - including those sent by former mp brooks newmark and tory official iain corby.
the quiz , which was answered by hand , included a question on the worst thing about politics , which mr ed miliband said was prime minister 's questions - ' a bad advert for all of us '
