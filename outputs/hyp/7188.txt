london commuters faced traffic chaos this morning while thousands are still without power as firefighters battle to extinguish an underground blaze that has been raging for more than 24 hours.
more than 2,000 office workers had to be evacuated yesterday due to the fire in holborn which apparently started in a tunnel carrying electrical cables , causing flames to erupt from the pavement and filling the area with smoke.
although the blaze has now been brought under control it has not been put out entirely , and firefighters still do not know the cause of the fire.
commuters were urged to avoid travelling through holborn if possible , and firefighters were unable to estimate when the situation might return to normal
