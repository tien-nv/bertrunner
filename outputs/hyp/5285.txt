nicola sturgeon today threatened to ' change the direction ' of the uk parliament without even becoming an mp as the snp stepped up its demands on labour.
the snp leader insisted she would call the shots in the event of a hung parliament , even though she is not even standing for election to the commons.
the snp have enjoyed a surge in popularity since september 's referendum on independence , despite 55 per cent of people voting stay in the uk.
a new opinion poll by tns puts the snp on 54 per cent , up two points on two weeks ago , with labour down two points to 22 per cent
