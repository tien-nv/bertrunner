one theory is that early modern humans ' bullied ' their neanderthals cousins to the point of extinction because they had better tools to survive.
but a new study of ancient stone tools contradicts this theory by suggesting human weapons were no better than those created by neanderthals.
the researchers studied stone tools that were used by people in the early ahmarian culture and the protoaurignacian culture , living in south and west europe and west south asia around 40,000 years ago.
they found the human tools ( pictured ) were no more effective than neanderthals - created tools of the same era researchers say the discovery means we may need to rethink the reasons humans survived neanderthals - and that we may not have behaved as differently as we thought
