i hope when you were sitting at home in front of your tellies looking forward to the latest instalment of the arsene vs jose show that you remembered all important thing : this classic managerial match - up is no capital club sprint , it âs a london derby marathon.
perhaps they can do that next year ? this year , instead , once the actual race was run , all roads led to the emirates and a sky sports team all set to act as pacemaker for the afternoon.
wenger has a look in the direction of mourinho during the stalemate at the emirates and , yes , of course they did bother to point out that there also happened to be an important game of football going on.
having just made it sound like some kind of premier league mayweather vs pacquiao match up , in fact both bosses were far from being in a combative mood in their pre match interviews
