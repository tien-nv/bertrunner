turkish has lifted a block on social media sites in the country after twitter , facebook and youtube agreed to remove chilling images of a prosecutor being held at gunpoint by left wing extremists.
a turkish court imposed the blocks yesterday because photographs of the deadly siege in which kiraz was killed were being widely shared on social media.
the 46 - year - old turkish prosecutor died in hospital when two members of the revolutionary people 's liberation party-front ( revolutionary people 's liberation party-front ) stormed a courthouse and took him hostage - uploading the photographs of kiraz with a gun pointed at his head to social media in the process.
turkish initially demanded domestic newspapers stop running the ' terrorist propaganda ' images , before going on to block access to twitter , facebook and youtube yesterday when requests to remove the photographs were ignored
