trott has admitted that he thought his england career was over after he reached ' breaking point ' in brisbane and was forced to quit the last ashes tour.
trott was forced to head home to an uncertain future after his ordeal at the hands of mitchell johnson in the first test but has battled back to be on the brink of making his 50th test appearance against west indies on monday.
' to be brutally honest i did n't know if i 'd be able to come back here and i did n't know if i was going to be selected but i had to get my head down and push my case forward and that 's all i could do.
i 'm really glad to be here , ' said a relaxed trott before england headed to antigua on friday
