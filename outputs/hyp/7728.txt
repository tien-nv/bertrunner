an orphan who survived a horrific plane crash that claimed the lives of nearly 80 babies and children 40 years ago has made an emotional return to the scene of one of the worst humanitarian disasters of the vietnam war.
landon and his twin sister lorie were initially thought to have died with scores of other youngsters when the first flight of operation babylift â an evacuation of vulnerable vietnamese orphans and children before the fall of saigon â crashed minutes after take - off.
incredibly , with wreckage and bodies strewn over miles of countryside , the terrified 17 - month - old twins were found huddled together in a rice paddy more than a day after the crash and later taken to their adoptive parents in the u.s. who had earlier been told they were dead.
now 41 , landon has visited the crash scene and is thought to be the first child survivor to return to the countryside on the outskirts of saigon where the c - 5 military cargo plane crashed and broke up killing 78 children and 50 adults on april 4 , 1975
