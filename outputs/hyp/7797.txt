abc 's world news tonight evening newscast has officially overtaken underfire rival nbc 's nightly news in the ratings war for the first time in more than five and a half years.

muir 's world news tonight evening newscast has officially overtaken underfire rival nbc 's nightly news in the ratings war for the first time in more than five and a half years as well as coming in the wake of brian williams ' suspension , the switch also follows a change in how the numbers are crunched which now prevents nbc from including repeat numbers of its newscast from overnight replays
