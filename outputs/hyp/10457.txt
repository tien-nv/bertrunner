washington nearly 6 in 10 americans say that businesses that provide wedding - related services should be required to provide those services to same - sex couples in the same way they would all other customers , even if they have religious objections.
a new cnn / orc poll finds 57 % feel businesses such as caterers or florists should be required to serve gay or lesbian couples just as they would heterosexual couples , while 41 % say they should be allowed to refuse service for religious reasons.
that 's a shift from a pew poll conducted last fall , which found just 49 % thought businesses ought to be required to serve same - sex couples while 47 % that they should be allowed to refuse service on religious grounds.
since the pew poll last fall , indiana 's religious freedom restoration act , signed into law in late march by republican governor pence , sparked a nationwide controversy over whether the law allowed wedding - related businesses to refuse service to gay and lesbian couples
