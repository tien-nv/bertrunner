it looks like your typical outback fibro home , tin roof and all , but this property which is currently for sale is now at the centre of one of australia 's most chilling murder mysteries.
for days now , detectives have swarmed over three bedroom leeton home where scott 's accused killer , high school cleaner stanford , 24 , lived with his mother anika and elder brother luke.
detectives had first arrived at the property on wednesday night speaking to two occupants before mr stanford arrived home and charged after investigators discovered discrepancies in his alibi.
police allege they discovered blood inside the school cleaner 's toyota hilux , a picture of a burnt body on his mobile phone and a set of school keys thought to belong to ms scott inside the property itself
