the 117 migrants , mostly from africa , arrived in the port of augusta , sicily , around 1p.m.
the two boats they had been in were barely seaworthy , the tug 's montenegrin captain told me.
we had flown to sicily from rome following news that as many as 400 migrants had been lost at sea.
the tragedy adds to the mounting death toll among those fleeing war and poverty in africa and the middle east
