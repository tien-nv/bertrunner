in case you needed a reminder that president obama is n't running for office again , he just alienated not only republicans , who have largely resented him from day one , but the progressive base of democratic voters.
obama has argued with the progressive potentate elizabeth warren , calling her " wrong " on trade policy.
the massachusetts senator is the same potentate to whom hillary clinton has been religiously prostrating.
warren has publicly criticized so - called " fast track " trade authority that would allow the white house to negotiate massive , multination trade deals with little congressional oversight
