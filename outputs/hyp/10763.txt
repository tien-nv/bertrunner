the onslaught on houthis rebels in yemen continued tuesday , with the saudi - led coalition asserting increasing control while locals fled the chaos and casualties piled up -- dozens of civilians among them.
five days after their first airstrikes , the coalition has destroyed air defense systems of the houthis and supporters of yemen 's longtime president saleh , and rendered all but a fraction of air bases and stripes unusable , a saudi source said.
saudi 's navy now controls all yemen ports , allowing only closely watched non-military medical goods to pass its blockade , according to the source.
" the houthis militia and agents of the former president -- supported by iranian -- insist to meddle in yemen , reshuffle the cards , rob the yemen will , make a coup against the constitutional legitimacy and reject all peaceful solutions , " prince saud al-faisal said , according to the state - run saudi press agency
