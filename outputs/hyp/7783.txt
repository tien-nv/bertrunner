premier league clubs are now so wealthy through their tv deals that they can afford to turn down a title sponsorship worth Â£ 45million a year.
guinness offered the top flight a huge deal of Â£ 135m over three years , a Â£ 5m - a - year increase on the payments from barclays , whose 15 - year partnership with the premier league will finish at the end of next season.
but the clubs awash with over Â£ 5billion from domestic tv rights alone rejected the bid from guinness âs parent company diageo , in part because some teams have conflicting beer deals.
the premier league has turned down a bid from guinness to replace barclays as the title sponsor instead the premier league want as much as Â£ 60m a year from a mega title backer but will also examine a multi-partnership sponsorship model
