is there anything laser ca n't do ? from cutting diamonds to preserving endangered sites , all the way to building terrifying weapons and turning your eyes from brown to blue , there is apparently no end to the list of applications for laser.
swiss physicist jean-pierre wolf is working on yet another impressive addition to that list : using focused laser beams to affect the weather.
it sounds like black magic , but it 's actually a cleaner version of cloud seeding , a form of weather modification that has been used for several years -- most famously by china in preparation for the 2008 olympics , when they launched rockets to seed the clouds and prevent rainfall during the opening ceremony.
how does laser actually affect the weather ? just like cloud seeding , it can create new clouds where there are none , by inducing condensation : naturally occurring water vapor is condensed into droplets , and ice crystals form , mimicking the natural process that creates clouds
