captured in a front room in bahama , north carolina , the three dogs â a husky called sky , a brown and white springer spaniel called sadie and a black and white springer spaniel called marshall â take their positions on their make - shift stage.
getting the tune underway , sadie begins barking and then rests her muzzle on sky âs ear as if whispering something â sky reacts by playfully mouthing in her direction.
the video begins with sadie the springer spaniel barking and interacting with the husky named sky the springer spaniel then begins barking some more and suddenly the husky joins it , but instead produces a far more pleasant sounding howl
