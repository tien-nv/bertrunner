the dpp was under growing pressure to stand down last night over her failure to put janner on trial for serious child abuse offences.
saunders âs position as the country âs top prosecutor looked bleak as she faced unprecedented criticism from the home secretary , police chiefs , crime tsars , prominent mps â and even one of her predecessors.
mrs saunders said her job as head of the cps was to make the correct legal decisions in difficult cases , not the most popular ones.
but she was accused of ignoring the rights of victims and of perpetrating establishment cover - ups by deciding that labour peer janner should not be charged â despite evidence of 22 offences against nine victims dating back to the 1960s
