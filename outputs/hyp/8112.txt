connolly had n't seen his teenage cousin in 10 years when she added him on facebook out of the blue in december.
the 23 - year - old sunshine coast university student was enjoying semester break and training hard in the hope of one day representing australia as a champion sprinter.
he messaged his 17 - year - old cousin angela * ( name has been changed for legal reasons ) to see how she was doing and soon found out she was homeless , illiterate and 32 weeks pregnant.
mr connolly picked her up from where she was sleeping rough on the gold coast , let her move into his flat , took care of her through the final stage of her pregnancy and is now helping to raise her four - week - old baby boy
