a former fortune 500 executive from new hampshire who caused a highway crash that killed a vermont couple and their unborn baby was accused of being ' heartless ' in court on wednesday by angry family members.
prosecutors have said dellinger told investigators he was trying to kill himself in december 2013 when he drove his pickup truck across an interstate 89 median and smashed into an suv carrying 24 - year - old murphy , who was 8 months pregnant , and her fiance , 29 - year - old jason timmons.
relatives of murphy and timmons tore into dellinger during the first of the two - day sentencing hearing.
