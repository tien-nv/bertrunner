london a poles prince has challenged populist britain politician nigel farage to a duel in london 's hyde park over his immigration policy.
nigel farage , the leader of the britain ukip ( ukip ) , complains that britain 's membership of the european union means it is powerless to stop a flow of foreign immigrants , many from impoverished eastern europe , into his " small island " nation.
in a video posted on youtube , prince zylinski said he was fed up with discrimination against poles living in britain.
" the most idiotic example i 've heard of has been mr. nigel farage blaming migrants for traffic jams on the m40 , " zylinksi said
