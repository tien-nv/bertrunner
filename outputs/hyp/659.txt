a federal judge has ordered the irs to hand over a list of the 298 tea party organizations that it targeted with broad and often intrusive questions when they applied for nonprofit tax - exempt status.
the decision from americans district judge dlott means right - wing groups are a step closer to being allowed to pursue a class - action lawsuit against the irs.
the agency has admitted playing political favorites with the tax code beginning in 2010 , when it began applying extra scrutiny to groups with red - flag words like ' patriots ' or ' tea party ' in their names.
dlott agreed this week that the tea party groups suing the government can pursue their claims that the irs violated their first and fifth amendment rights , along with a section of federal law â section 6103 of title 26 â that prohibits the government from releasing private information contained in tax returns
