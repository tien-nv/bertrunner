bangkok thailand has lifted martial law , replacing it with it a controversial new security order granting sweeping powers to the ruling military junta.
critics have expressed alarm at the move , with human rights watch 's asia director adams saying it marked the country 's " deepening descent into dictatorship.
" martial law was lifted wednesday when the thailand king bhumibol adulyadej approved a request from prime minister general prayuth to proceed.
prayuth -- head of the ncpo ( ncpo ) junta -- immediately invoked article 44 of the country 's interim constitution " to curb acts deemed harmful to national peace and stability
