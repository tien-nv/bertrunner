a woman who ended up getting lost while running a marathon in raleigh , north carolina and ended up having to hitch a ride with the cops to get back on course , still won her race some nine minutes ahead of her closest competitor.
heidi bretscher 's troubles began around mile 17 of the rock n ' roll raleigh marathon that took place earlier this month.
the 28 - year - old runner was so far ahead of the pack it was n't clear to her which way she was meant to go.
wrong way : heidi bretscher , 28 , said she was on pace to beat her personal record when she , and the two cyclists who were accompanying her , missed an unmarked turn retracing her steps : at mile 19 , heidi bretscher was leading the women 's race by about 30 minutes
