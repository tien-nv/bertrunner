but amelia - jane harris , 20 , says her new ' dream body ' is actually a nightmare , as crohn 's disease means she is in constant pain and can not eat.
the illness has seen miss jane harris lose more than 18 stone ( 252lbs ) in 20 months , as she regularly vomits up her food and suffers excruciating bowel pain.
at her largest , when she weighed 27st 10lbs ( 388lbs ) and was a size 32 , she dreamed of pulling off skimpy outfits.
but now , weighing just 8st 9lbs ( 121lbs ) and wearing size 6 clothes , she says she would give anything to get back her fuller figure back and be able to eat normally again
