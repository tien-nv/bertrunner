suddenly , in the middle of the new york city night , edward snowden 's familiar bespectacled face appeared - deep in a public park.
a 4 - foot - high , 100 - pound sculpted bust of the infamous nsa whistle - blower now exiled in russia was sneaked into brooklyn 's fort greene park in the pre-dawn hours monday.
animal new york city , a city news website that first reported the incident , said the mysterious perpetrators were a trio of guerrilla artists â admirers of the former government contractor who had leaked thousands of pages of classified information from the nsa detailing a massive domestic spying program to the media.
at daybreak , police said city parks officials ordered the sculpted edward snowden removed from the top of prison ship martyrs monument , which honors the 11,500 patriots who died aboard british prison ships during the revolutionary war
