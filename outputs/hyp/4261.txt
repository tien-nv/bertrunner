another day , another baton change , another away defeat for middlesbrough.
karanka would surely have made his defenders walk home from watford were it not for the probability they âd spend most of the journey travelling in circles.
this was that kind of game , a top - of - the - table occasion when middlesbrough needed to deliver but ultimately failed on every scale â they did not create , they did not contain.
