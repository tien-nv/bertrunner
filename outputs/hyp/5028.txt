wilfried zaha has admitted he felt â worthless â during his two - year spell as a manchester united player after his dream move to old trafford turned sour.
the 22 - year - old winger was signed by then old trafford boss sir ferguson in january 2013 from palace for Â£ 10million.
but the terms of the transfer saw him loaned straight back to the palace for the remainder of the season and he did not arrive at old trafford until the summer , by which time ferguson had retired and been replaced by moyes.
wilfried zaha has rediscovered his form at palace this season during a disastrous campaign for the club under moyes , zaha made just four manchester united appearances before playing out the second half of last season at cardiff
