what cook did here , particularly in the first hour of his innings , was spot - on.
this was really encouraging for the england captain but ultimately hugely frustrating because he could nât push on to that all - important hundred.
cook 's innings into day three in grenada was spot on , particularly the first hour of it cook worked his way to an encouraging 50 but frustratingly was out playing gabriel on for 76 yet it is nonsense to say a batsman who has hit 25 test hundreds can not drive the ball.
perhaps it has been playing too much one - day cricket , perhaps it has just been the pressure to score big runs again , but cook has been searching for the ball far too early
