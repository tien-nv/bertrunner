a senior labour mp has admitted that the party would look to ' forge a common alliance ' with the snp to ensure miliband becomes prime minister.
david lammy , who is standing for london mayor , said the snp was a party labour could ' do business with ' in the event of another hung parliament.
the admission comes amid increasingly stark warnings from the tories that the snp will hold labour to ' ransom ' if it holds the balance of power in parliament next month.
but the scottish first minister has vowed to work with mr miliband to ' lock out ' david cameron from number 10 in exchange for higher government spending , more taxes and increased borrowing
