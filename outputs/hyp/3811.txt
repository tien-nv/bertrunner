it could have easily been passed off as an april fools ' day joke , but for one couple winning the Â£ 53million euromillions jackpot was a reality.
richard and maxwell , from coningsby in lincolnshire , became 10th on the national lottery rich list after they scooped Â£ 53,193,914 on the draw on tuesday.
the couple , both 67 , so far have only modest plans for what to do with the huge windfall - with mr maxwell planning to retire and play bowls.
' mr maxwell said he was in shock when he saw only one ticket had won Â£ 53million and believed someone had scanned his ticket and put it on the website as a joke
