the secret service took more than a year to replace a broken alarm system at the home of bush , it has emerged.
the alarm failed at the former president 's houston residence in september 2013 and even though the secret service bought a replacement system in january 2014 , it took until december for it to be installed - leaving the couple without the protection of a working alarm at their home for 15 months.
it came despite an agent 's recommendation in 2010 that the alarm , which was installed in 1993 , be replaced because it ' had exceeded its life cycle '.
concerns : former first lady barbara bush and former president bush , pictured watching basketball in march , did not have a working alarm at their houston home for more than a year during the time the alarm was out of service , the secret service assigned an employee to keep watch over the residence , according to the report , cbs news reported
