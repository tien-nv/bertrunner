since returning home from our kickoff weekend where we got to experience life as a full - time triathlete , i 've been juggling training life with a full - time job , hectic commute and time with friends and family.
jae rockwell , the founder of my local women 's fitness groups , women run the world , posted this mantra to help us keep ourselves accountable.
annastasia w. , who 's training for her first ironman half - triathlon this summer , suggested a group brick workout at our local gym.
she invited several other women , including complete newbies , through the soletri sisters facebook group and 10 of us met up on a cold chicago morning to swim for 15 minutes , bike for 30 minutes and run for 15 minutes
