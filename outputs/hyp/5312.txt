chip shop boss john clarkson has created a new answer to the creme question of ' how do you eat yours ? ' - by turning the chocolate into a pie to serve with chips.
eschewing the savoury favourites of sausage and egg or mince pies , mr john clarkson decided to wrap the easter delicacies in pastry before they were battered and deep - fried.
the result is his very own ' pie-egg-ra ' dish-creme egg oozing from the traditional pie casing which is then served with chips to more adventurous customers at a price of Â£ 2.75.
the pie was created by blind - baking the casing as the egg would otherwise melt down , then one - and - a - half creme eggs were popped in as a filling
