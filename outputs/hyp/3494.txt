shell said it has filed a complaint in federal court in alaska seeking an order to remove greenpeace activists who climbed aboard an oil rig in the pacific bound for the arctic on monday in a protest against arctic drilling.
the environmental group said in a statement its team would occupy the underside of the main deck of the polar pioneer , which is under contract to shell , and plans to unfurl a banner with the names of millions of people opposed to arctic drilling.
shell said in an emailed statement that it has met with groups against oil drilling off alaska 's shores and ' respect their views ' but condemned the boarding.
' we can confirm that protesters from greenpeace have illegally boarded the polar pioneer , under contract to shell , jeopardizing not only the safety of the crew on board , but the protesters themselves , ' shell said
