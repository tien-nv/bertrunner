parents craig and bonnie morgan want their children to have the best possible start in life.
but so desperate are they to get their son craig â known to them as cj â into a local prep school that they âve put their house on the market in order to pay the fees.
they âve also slashed their weekly grocery bills by more than half , taken in lodgers , and have pinned their hopes on a â crowd - funding â initiative , hoping members of the public will help them achieve their dream.
they are selling it for Â£ 185,000 to help pay for craig jr 's prep school fees â we believe any child will benefit more from what a private education has to offer , â said mrs bonnie morgan
