a fumble from royals goalkeeper adam federici in extra time handed arsenal a 2 - 1 victory and a place in the fa cup final.
the royals keeper , who had made some fine saves earlier in the match , allowed alexis sanchez 's low shot to squirm between his legs and over the line on 115 minutes , which was enough to see the gunners return to wembley on may 30 to try to defend the trophy.
alexis sanchez had swept the gunners into the lead on 39 minutes.
however , royals were level when mccleary 's volley was deflected past goalkeeper wojciech szczesny , who could only palm the ball back over the line
