but this catholic had n't read it -- at least , not from cover to cover.
my name is laura bernardini and i 'm a director of coverage at cnn.com , which means i manage our newsgathering and newsroom in washington.
at work this week , i was talking with some colleagues about pope francis ' upcoming trip to the united states.
my excuse always has been that catholics have their bible passages read to them at mass every sunday
