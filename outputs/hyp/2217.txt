holy smokes ! researchers found the bombardier beetle mimics a machine gun by mixing chemicals in an internal ' reaction chamber ' a beetle with a machine gun built into its rear end sounds like something from a comic or sci - fi film - or the stuff of nightmares.
but researchers have discovered the bombardier beetle mimics this powerful weapon by mixing chemicals in an internal ' reaction chamber ' in its stomach.
when threatened , the diminutive bug can then repeatedly fire streams of foul - smelling liquid from its rear , complete with ' gun smoke '.
assistant professor moore , from the department of entomology at the university , has published a paper along with her team that not only reveals the beetle 's firing apparatus in never - before - seen detail , but also solves a long - standing mystery of how the animals achieve their incredible rapid - fire capabilities
