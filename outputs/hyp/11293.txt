after a weekend shipwreck off the coast of italian that may have killed hundreds of migrants , the international organization for migrants said monday that there may be three more migrant boats in distress in international waters.
authorities still do n't know the fate of many of the passengers , including children , who were on the large ship bound from libyan to european that capsized saturday night in the frigid waters of the mediterranean.
that sinking may be the worst in a series of disasters in which migrants have lost their lives on vessels that are too rickety to survive long voyages.
" gangs of criminals are putting people on a boat , sometimes even at gunpoint , " maltese prime minister muscat said
