stranded residents of last week 's devastating floods , who were unable to cross the water to attend an anzac day memorial service , were thrilled after a cornet player treated them to a rendition of the last post from the water 's edge.
maitland local karen newton , a teacher and former professional musician , had just finished playing at the kurri kurri dawn service and was on her way to gillieston heights to deliver food to the victims of the floods.
when she got to the water 's edge at testers hollow , ms karen newton plucked her cornet from the car and began playing the bugle call once again , across the water to the isolated residents in a goosebump - inducing moment.
winter , who filmed the video and posted it online , said that ms karen newton 's act is what anzac day is all about
