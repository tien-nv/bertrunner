the stars of scorsese 's classic 1990 gangster film goodfellas reunited in nyc on saturday night for a very special 25th anniversary screening of the movie which brought the 14th annual tribeca film festival to a close.
stars liotta , de niro , lorraine bracco and paul sorvino were all in attendance although director scorsese was filming in taiwan and joe pesci , who won an oscar for best supporting actor in 1991 for his turn as tommy devito , did n't show.
' joe pesci could n't be here , but he sent this email : ' f * * * , f * * * , f * * * , f * * * ity f * * * , f * * * ' read de niro , introducing the screening at the beacon theatre.
' remember that nice italian restaurant in tribeca that we used to go to ? and then when the film came out , the owner of the restaurant said we 're not allowed in anymore because we apparently denigrated a certain ethnic group for the picture ? ' said scorsese
