west brom manager pulis will receive a hero 's welcome when he returns to crystal palace on saturday but in the midst of yet another relegation battle for the 57 - year - old , he must wonder if he 'll ever be successful at the right end of the premier league.
for all the expertise pulis has in keeping clubs in the top flight , a talent that has the everlasting gratitude of stoke city and crystal palace supporters , his overall record is one of the worst of any long - serving premier league manager.
if , as expected , garry monk 's swansea city do n't drop lower than 10th , pulis will be the only manager in the premier league with more than 12 months experience who has never finished higher than 11th.
pulis has never managed to guide a team into the top half of the premier league to add to his frustration as he takes the applause of the crystal palace fans who remember him for masterminding their great escape last season , pulis will know he is n't yet guaranteed preserving his proud record of never being relegated
