homeless people in the bay area are being handed free smartphones by multi-billion dollar tech companies in the hope that it will get them off the streets.
a group called community technology alliance is giving away free google handsets which come loaded with apps that help the homeless find shelters , soup kitchens , and warn of severe weather.
the phones are also designed to help people apply for jobs and find housing , as companies often require people to visit their websites.
