indiana 's controversial religious freedom law has been in hot water lately.
after a firestorm of backlash and protests , gov. mike pence said on tuesday that the state will " fix " the rfra , or rfra , so it will not discriminate against gays and lesbians.
not all people who dislike the law hate religion , and not all people who like the law want to discriminate against the lgbt community.
the unbelievably easy way to fix indiana 's rfra is to add one small amendment , one easy line codifying that discrimination against the lgbt community is harmful , and that there is a compelling governmental interest in eliminating that harm
