a first - of - its - kind 3d simulation has revealed what happens when two supermassive black holes dramatically collide in a disk.
the video swoops around the disc of superheated material known as a quasar surrounding the black hole , showing how it takes shape.
and the simulation is particularly interesting , because recent observations show two such black holes are going to collide in just seven years - so the prediction can be tested in real life.
it shows what happens when two supermassive black holes collide the simulation was led by scientists at the university of illinois and included dr roman gold , dr vasileios paschalidis , dr stuart shapiro , dr milton ruiz , dr zachariah etienne , and dr harald pfeiffer
