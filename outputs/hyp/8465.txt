thinking about vacating the white house probably is n't president obama 's favorite thing to do , but it is n't his impending departure that stresses him the most - it 's the prospect of his eldest daughter leaving white house and heading off to college that really gets him down.
heading to college has him crying on a daily basis ca n't let her go : the 11th grade student ( left ) is already visiting schools and will go to college in the fall of 2016 so sad : president obama said he 's ' sad ' and he ' starts tearing up in the middle of the day and i ca n't explain it ' he said on tuesday during the easter prayer breakfast : ' i start tearing up in the middle of the day and i ca n't explain it , why am i so sad ? ' they 're leaving me.
' thankfully : malia 's ( right ) younger sister sasha , 13 ( center ) , wo n't start thinking about college for a few years yet if malia attends columbia for an undergraduate degree , she will be following in her father 's footsteps
