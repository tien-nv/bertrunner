the irish student allegedly raped by a wall st banker in the hamptons told how she used ' every ounce of strength left inside me ' to throw him off whilst he violently assaulted her.
the 22 - year - old said she kneed lee , an ex-goldman sachs managing director , in the groin during the struggle after he forced her onto the floor whilst naked in the bathroom of his $ 35,000 a month rented mansion.
she sobbed and said she was left in a state of ' disbelief ' and begged her friends to take her home - because she felt that it was her fault.
