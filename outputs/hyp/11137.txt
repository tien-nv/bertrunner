the mother of a quadriplegic man who police say was left in the woods for days can not be extradited to face charges in philadelphia until she completes an unspecified " treatment , " maryland police said monday.
the montgomery county ( maryland ) department of police took parler , 41 , into custody sunday after philadelphia police reported that she left her 21 - year - old son in the woods while she hopped a bus to see her boyfriend in maryland.
a man walking through the woods found him friday " lying in leaves , covered in a blanket with a bible and a wheelchair nearby , " philadelphia police say.
citing federal health care privacy laws , montgomery county police spokesman capt. starks said he could not divulge why parler was receiving treatment , but he said she had to complete it before she could be extradited
