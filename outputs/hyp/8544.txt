secretary of state john kerry ' is delusional ' if he expected to claim the iran agreed to the phased lifting of sanctions as part of a nuclear deal when they did n't and get away with it , says the chairman of the senate , john mccain.
' i think john kerry tried to come back and sell a bill of goods , hoping maybe that the iran would nât say much about it , ' the gop lawmaker told radio host hewitt during his thursday program.
john mccain , responding to the supreme leader of iran 's proclamation yesterday that there would be no formal pact unless sanctions relief is ' instant , ' said he had ' sympathy ' for iran ayatollah ayatollah , because john kerry ' must have known ' what the perimeters were for a long - term accord ' and yet chose to interpret it in another way.
' launching a rare attack from his official white house twitter account , president obama 's spokesman josh earnest in turn said it was ' naÃ¯ve and reckless ' for john mccain ' to believe every word of the supreme leader 's political speech
