for celtic , a slow - burning season has seen deila âs side raise their game after a stuttering start and eventually rout their nearest rivals.
their steady emergence under the norwegian has seen them swat aside second - placed aberdeen 8 - 2 on aggregate over three matches and eradicate fourth - placed dundee united 17 - 3 over the course of six games.
yet although the parkhead side have in recent times looked like an increasingly irresistible force in the race for the treble , it has been left to third - placed inverness to enhance their credentials as the team most likely to represent a potential stumbling block on deila âs march towards history.
