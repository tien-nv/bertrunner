miliband âs son has inadvertently waded into the row about the labour âs kitchen as he declared it â the best â in his house.
the unwitting admission from five - year - old daniel , to be broadcast tonight , came as mr miliband yet again wheeled out his children for the cameras.
it is the fourth time they have appeared on screen during the campaign â once for a bbc profile , again for an interview on itv âs good morning britain , a third time for a campaign visit in blackpool over easter , and again this evening on itv.
and it led to accusations that mr miliband lives an â upstairs , downstairs â lifestyle last night as he was forced to admit that he needs two kitchens because the family nanny lives in the basement of his north london â mansion â
