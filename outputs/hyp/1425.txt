a former utah high school teacher accused of having sex with three of her male students took a plea deal wednesday to avoid a trial , sobbing as she accepted the agreement in court.
one of the boys was 16 and two were 17 when they were having sex with davis high school english teacher brianne altice , 35.
but the boys were all minors , and utah law also says a person can not consent to sex if the other person is in a position of special trust.
altice could face up to 45 years in prison when she is sentenced next month
