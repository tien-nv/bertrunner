north korea accused mexico of illegally holding one of its cargo ships wednesday and demanded the release of the vessel and crew.
mexico defended the move wednesday , saying it followed proper protocol because the company that owns the ship , north korea 's ocean maritime management company , has skirted u.n. sanctions.
but an myong hun , north korea 's deputy ambassador to the u.n. , said there was no reason to hold the mu du bong and accused mexico of violating the crew members ' human rights by keeping them from their families
