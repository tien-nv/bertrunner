v.stiviano , the alleged mistress of clippers owner donald , who he showered with expensive gifts , has been ordered to pay his wife $ 2.6million.
los angeles judge richard fruin jr. awarded shelly most of the nearly $ 3million she had sought.
lawyers for donald had claimed that money used to buy stiviano a house , luxury cars and stocks was her community property the couple had acquired over six decades of marriage.
stiviano 's lawyer had argued that the gifts were made when donald and shelly were separated and that shelly could n't seek them from a third party
