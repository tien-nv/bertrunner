now scientists have identified the unfortunate individual whose bones were found fused to the walls of a cave in lamalunga , near altamura , in southern italy.
using analysis of dna extracted from the bones sticking out from the limestone rock , researchers have found he was a neanderthal who fell down a sinkhole around 150,000 years ago.
over the thousands of years that followed , the body decayed and the remaining bones gradually became incorporated into the stalactites left behind by water dribbling down the cave walls.
the dna is the oldest to ever be extracted from a neanderthal and the researchers now hope to further analyse the genetic information from the skeleton
