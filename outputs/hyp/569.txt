president obama this morning put a human face on the harmful effects climate change can have on public health - his daughter malia.
while making the case that higher temperatures lead to increases in wildfires , which send allergy - causing particulates into the air that can lead to greater and more serious incidents of asthma , the president recalled his own child 's run - in with the disease as a toddler.
' well you know , malia had asthma when she was four , and because we had good health insurance , we were able to knock it out early , ' the president told abc news â chief health correspondent , dr. richard besser , in an interview that aired on good morning america.
' obama said the health scare resulted in a single trip to the emergency room for his daughter - who at the age of 16 now lives a full and an active life , inhaler free - but other children are n't so fortunate
