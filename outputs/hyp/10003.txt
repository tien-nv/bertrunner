it 's long been known that earthquakes and their seismic activity contribute to this ringing , but researchers have now proved ocean waves also play a role.
as so - called short waves collide near the surface they create weak microseismic waves , which combine with long , more powerful waves dragging across the ocean 's floor to create the constant hum. it 's long been known that earthquakes contribute to making the earth ring like a bell , but researchers have now proved ocean waves also play a role.
as short waves collide near the surface they create weak microseismic waves , which combine with long waves on the ocean 's floor to create a constant hum earthquakes shake the planet in such a way that the earth can oscillate for months after the seismic event.
in the late 1990s , however , seismologists found that the planet does n't just oscillate following quakes , and instead is vibrating at extremely low frequencies all of the time
