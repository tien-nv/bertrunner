now genetic research has revealed that ancient european populations were dark skinned for far longer than had originally been thought.
rather than lightening as early humans migrated north from africa around 40,000 years ago due to lower levels of sunlight , these first homo sapiens retained their dark skin colour.
it was not until 7,800 years ago , when the first farmers migrated from the near east through turkey that two key genes that provide lighter skin appeared.
dna analysis obtained from ancient human remains has shown that as these farmers bred with the dark skinned hunter gatherers , one of these genes became prevalent in the european population and european 's skin colour began to lighten
