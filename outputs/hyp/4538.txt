overall i âm sure miliband âs coaching team will be patting themselves on the back and declaring a win but his gesticulation and approach looked as manicured and choreographed as a torville and dean routine.

miliband âs coaching team will be patting themselves on the back and declaring a win following the debate but his gesticulation and approach looked as manicured and choreographed as a torville and dean routine farage ( left and right ) was diminished during this debate , perhaps the only casualty of the night , and it was the women who finally took him down with a few small swats who do you think won the leaders ' tv debate ? who do you think won the leaders ' tv debate ? now share your opinion he took enough pops at cameron and waved his arm enough in that direction to signal an official end to the relationship that began in the rose garden but he looked more congruent agreeing with cameron or fielding criticism as a double act than he did turning on him , which looked rather panto.
