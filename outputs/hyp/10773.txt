seventy years ago , anne died of typhus in a nazi concentration camp at the age of 15.
just two weeks after her supposed death on march 31 , 1945 , the bergen-belsen concentration camp where she had been imprisoned was liberated -- timing that showed how close the jewish diarist had been to surviving the holocaust.
but new research released by the anne frank house shows that anne and her older sister , margot frank , died at least a month earlier than previously thought.
they concluded that anne and margot frank probably did not survive to march 1945 -- contradicting the date of death which had previously been determined by dutch authorities
