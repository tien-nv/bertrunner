seaworld has been accused of drugging killer whales , painting over their injuries and keeping them in pools so shallow they get sunburned.
a lawsuit filed by kuhl , a grandmother from south carolina who visited the orlando park in 2013 , claims orcas are being kept in 8ft deep holding pools , leaving the marine animals ' essentially roasting '.
in her suit she also alleges that the giant marine mammals are being deprived of food for days while being trained to perform at seaworld , and that the chlorine used in their tanks is ' many times stronger than household bleach '.
