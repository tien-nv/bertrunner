sussex head coach robinson has warned that wicketkeeper matt prior remains ' pretty much out indefinitely ' as his recovery from an achilles injury continues.
prior , 33 , was badly affected by the problem last summer , eventually losing his england place to jos buttler , and has not played since july.
he took a break to focus on rehabilitation and admitted ' i could have played my last game ( for england ) ' - and robinson 's prognosis offers no further encouragement.
