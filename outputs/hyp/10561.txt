baghdad , iraq hundreds of additional iraq troops are being sent to reinforce colleagues who are trying to fend off isis ' attempt to overrun iraq 's largest oil refinery , a key paramilitary force said tuesday.
the reinforcements come four days after isis began attacking northern iraq 's baiji oil refinery , a key strategic resource that has long been a target because the facility refines much of the fuel used by iraq domestically.
the reinforcements include two federal police regiments , an iraq military quick reaction force battalion and a regiment from hasd al-shaabi , which is a predominantly shia militia that worked with the iraq military as well as sunni fighters to liberate tikrit from isis about two weeks ago
