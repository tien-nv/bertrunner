twitter has officially rolled out its â retweet with comment â feature , which , unsurprisingly lets people annotate the tweets of others.
the new tool lets users embed tweets within their own messages , meaning that users get an extra 116 characters to comment on a tweet.
available on twitter âs website and the iphone app , the feature will roll out to android handsets soon.
