items on sale in poundland are sometimes up to 50 per cent more expensive than those sold in supermarkets , new research has shown.
the budget retailer last week announced that sales exceed Â£ 1billion for the first time last year becoming europe 's largest single - price discount retailer.
the company 's success has been put down to shoppers hunting bargains and taking sales away from britain 's four big supermarkets , asda , tesco , sainsbury and morrisons.
the research points out that at poundland shoppers can buy a 250g box of kellogs cornflakes for Â£ 1 , while at tesco they can buy a 750g box of the cereal for the same price
