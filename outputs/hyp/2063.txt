holland manager hiddink has slammed his own supporters for booing iniesta during his side 's 2 - 0 victory against spain on tuesday night and branded them a ' disgrace '.
spain coach vicente del bosque fielded an experimental side at the amsterdam arena with iniesta , who started on the bench , entering the fray in the 76th minute to chorus of jeering and boos from the home fans.
centre back stefan de vrij and midfielder klaassen scored first - half goals in the morale - boosting victory , but hiddink was unimpressed with the way iniesta was treated.
