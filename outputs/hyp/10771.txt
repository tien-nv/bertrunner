president barack obama tied himself to the mast of a nuclear deal with iran even before he became the democratic candidate for president.
but the process has unfolded under the destructive influence of political considerations , weakening united states 's hand and strengthening iran.
barack obama 's political standing and his historic legacy in foreign policy are so deeply intertwined with reaching an accord with iran that if the deal ultimately collapses , he may fear that historians will conclude that his legacy in global affairs collapsed with it.
there is a reason one gets the feeling that it is the united states and not iran that is the more eager , even desperate , side in these talks , even though iran is the country whose economy was sent into a deep chill by international sanctions ; the country whose only significant export , oil , lost more than half of its value in recent months
