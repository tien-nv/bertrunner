a skywest inc pilot plunged a plane carrying 75 passengers into a terrifying dive on wednesday after a reported , potentially catastrophic loss of cabin pressure in mid-air.
frightened passengers held their heads and prayed as flight 5622 , operating as a united express , dropped nearly 30,000 feet in eight minutes and made an emergency landing in buffalo , new york.
the situation arose about an hour after take - off , when three passengers on the embraer e170 175 twin - jet from chicago to connecticut lost consciousness and others began feeling dizzy and sick.
when the plane landed , skywest inc initially claimed that the aircraft landed ' out of an abundance of caution ' because of one sick passenger and denied there was any mechanical malfunction - which conflicted with reports from people on the plane
