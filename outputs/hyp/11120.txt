a former navy aircraft carrier that survived a japan torpedo strike and was a massive guinea pig for two atomic bomb blasts looks remarkably intact at the bottom of the pacific ocean , according to federal researchers who surveyed the wreck last month with an underwater drone.
the uss independence was scuttled in january 1951 during weapons testing near california 's farallon islands.
although its location was confirmed by a survey in 2009 , researchers from the noaa went looking for it again in march as part of a project to map about 300 wrecks that lie in and around the gulf of the farallones national marine sanctuary.
noaa 's survey of the 623 - foot - long , 11,000 - ton carrier was conducted by the echo ranger , an 18.5 - foot - long autonomous underwater vehicle provided by the boeing co. the echo ranger traveled 30 miles from its base in half moon bay , california , and hovered 150 above the carrier , which lies 2,600 feet below the surface of the pacific ocean
