indonesia 's attorney - general has claimed that bali nine duo andrew chan and myuran sukumaran will be put to death following the rejection of their last ditch legal appeals.
the convicted australians drug dealers learned about the ruling after an appeal against their death row sentence was allowed to proceed in jakarta 's state administrative court on monday.
the court decided against allowing the pair 's lawyers to challenge indonesia president joko widodo 's decision to deny the two australians clemency.
sydney men andrew chan , 31 , and myuran sukumaran , 33 , have been awaiting execution on the death island of nusakambangan with seven other prisoners after they were transferred from their home of almost ten years â bali 's notorious kerobokan prison â in a dramatic show of force last month
