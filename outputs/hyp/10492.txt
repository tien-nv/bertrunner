bachmann is comparing president obama to the co-pilot of the doomed germanwings flight.
" with his iran deal , obama is for the 300 million souls of the united states what andreas lubitz was for the 150 souls on the german wings flight - a deranged pilot flying his entire nation into the rocks , " the minnesota gop and former representative wrote in a facebook comment posted march 31.
" after the fact , among the smoldering remains of united states cities , the shocked survivors will ask , why did he do it ? " andreas lubitz , the co-pilot of germanwings flight 9525 , is accused by authorities of deliberately crashing the plane in the french alps.
the motive of the march 24 crash is under investigation , though investigators are looking in to whether andreas lubitz feared a medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot 's license
