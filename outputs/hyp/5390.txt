these eerie photographs show the inside of an abandoned 19th century victorian asylum which has lay dormant for 20 years.
opened in 1818 , the asylum once housed nearly 1,000 patients and expands over 350 metres in length overlooking the town of stafford in the west midlands.
it closed in 1995 but is now set to have new life breathed into it after planning permission was granted to build 102 apartments in its place.
shattered doors , overturned bathtubs and crumbling floors dominate the grade ii listed st george 's county asylum where patients were restrained by means of ' the leather muff , ' ' iron handcuffs ' and ' restraint chair '
