you could have fried an egg on david cameron âs upper lip yesterday afternoon when he appeared in sunny bristol.
the pm was speaking in a rather peculiar building â an almost empty science park on the city âs outskirts , its round atrium area filled with party activists.
the space was uncomfortably hot and mr david cameron was looking straight into a merciless , piercing , armpit - moistening sun. the prime ministerial upper lip was soon glistening.
attack of the sweats ! david cameron worked up a sweat as he made a visit to poole in dorset and sunny bristol
