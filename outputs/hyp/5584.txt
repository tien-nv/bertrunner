many couples disagree over what to name their children â but one new york couple âs battle over their unborn baby âs moniker became so unbearable that they have asked random members of the public to help them reach a decision.
kseniya , who is due in august , wants to name her unborn child michael , after her late father.
baby name showdown : nicholas and kseniya ca n't agree over whether to name their child spyridon or michael , which nicholas says his wife will shorten to mischa ' the argument is serious â it âs not a joke , ' kseniya , 33 , told the new york post.
mystery child : the couple does n't yet know the sex of their baby ; if it 's a girl , nicolas will surrender all naming rights to kseniya while they wait to find out , nicholas is hoping to get 100,000 signatures supporting his choice â the magic number that his wife agreed would be enough for him to get his way
