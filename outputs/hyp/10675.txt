if i had to describe the united states - iran relationship in one word it would be " overmatched.
iran has no problem reconciling its bad and contradictory behavior while we twist ourselves into knots over our tough choices , all the while convincing ourselves that united states 's policy on the nuclear issue is on the right track.
iran is n't 10 feet tall in this region , but by making the nuclear issue the be-all and end - all that is supposed to reduce iran 's power , the united states is only making teheran taller.
iran is about to try a united states citizen and washington post reporter and we have made a judgment that even while we protest , we will keep the nuclear issue separated not just from this case but from iran 's serial abuse of human rights , including the behavior of its shia militias in iraq
