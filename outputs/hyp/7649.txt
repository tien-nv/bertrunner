klitschko has reached rare territory among heavyweight champions.
now , in his ninth year as champion , klitschko is catching joe louis and larry holmes in successful defences.
when klitschko faces bryant jennings on april 25 at new york 's madison square garden , he will risk his heavyweight belt for the 18th time.
a win over bryant jennings will place klitschko within one successful defense of larry holmes but he would still need six additional wins to match joe louis ' record of 25
