the church of scientology is one on a long list of organisations that have been barred from using the anzac brand by the department of veteran affairs ahead of april 25.
out of 384 applications that have inundated the department over the past 12 months about 80 per cent have been approved to use the word anzac , which stands for the australians and new zealand army corp. forty - four items were rejected for a range of reasons , including it was too commercial or its name was inappropriate.
organisations such as the church of scientology , woolworths , and online sites teespring , zazzle and redbubble were reprimanded for using the word anzac.
the church used the brand in an attempt to raise $ 10,000 worth of donations to open new centre in auckland in new zealanders , while woolworths caused controversy for overlaying its logo and ' fresh in our memories ' on photographs of war veterans
