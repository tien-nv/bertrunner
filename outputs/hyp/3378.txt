a uk mother is among nearly 100 women who have had babies by a denmark sperm donor who has triggered an international scare over the spread of an incurable genetic disease.
the man , known only as donor 7042 , carries a defective gene known as neurofibromatosis 1 ( nf1 ) that can pass on a severe , life - limiting condition to his offspring.
with demand for denmark sperm soaring , the donor is understood to have fathered 99 â viking babies â â as they are widely dubbed â across the world through the clinic nordic cryobank.
now four families are suing the sperm bank and the case has raised questions among fertility experts about denmark âs booming , and unregulated , sperm export trade
