a jobless alcoholic has boasted of fathering 40 children who have cost the taxpayer more than Â£ 4million in benefits and care costs.
shameless holpin â who at 56 says he wants more children â claims he had them by 20 women and admits he would not recognise many of his offspring in the street.
' i wo n't stop ' : father of 40 holpin , left and right with his fiancÃ©e diane , says he wants more children because it is ' god 's will ' his relationships have broken down because of his drinking and womanising , and the recovering alcoholic says 16 of his children have been taken into care at some stage in their lives.
mr holpin or the children âs mothers would also have been able to claim at least Â£ 500,000 in child benefit and a further Â£ 800,000 in child tax credits
