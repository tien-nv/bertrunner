manchester united boss louis van gaal has warned his players that champions league qualification is still not assured despite holding an eight - point gap over liverpool after saturday 's results.
following a comprehensive 3 - 1 victory against aston villa , van gaal sees next sunday 's derby against manchester city at old trafford as important in the battle to finish runners - up.
but having been given the task of qualifying for the top - four when he replaced david moyes last summer , he is not letting complacency risk success , though liverpool 's 4 - 1 defeat against arsenal on satuday lunchtime puts united firmly in pole position.
