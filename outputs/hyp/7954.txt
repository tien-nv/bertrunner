harrowing images reveal one of west - african 's vast electronic graveyards where ' millions of tonnes ' of discarded appliances from all over the world - including the uk - are being dumped every year.
thousands of broken televisions , computers , microwaves and refrigerators are being illegally exported to african countries and dumped gigantic landfills like agbogbloshie in ghana because it costs less than recycling them in their countries of origin , campaigners claim.
41 million tonnes of ' e-waste ' worth over Â£ 34billion were discarded globally in 2014 , according to a shocking report by unu who claim only 6 million tonnes of that was recycled properly.
that dwarfs the 1.9 million tonnes produced by the whole of african and yet the continent 's western nations have become a dumping ground for the world 's defunct products
