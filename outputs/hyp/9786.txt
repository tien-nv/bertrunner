nestled in eastern long island is a sleepy little town called yaphank where the streets have cozy names like oak and park , names that hide a dark past : they once bore signs like hitler and goebbels streets.
yaphank , in the 1930s , appeared as a haven for u.s. -- most of them of german heritage -- who sympathized with the causes of the nazi.
in fact , it was largely founded as a nazi camp , one of several scattered across the u.s. , where the children in the german american bund ( aka american nazis ) could fish , swim , hunt and learn about things like eugenics.
the group set up pro-nazi camps where they could put on military demonstrations , teach their children about fascism and enjoy the outdoors today , yaphank is still a town on long island
