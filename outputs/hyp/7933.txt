marathon bomber dzhokar tsarnaev has been thrown another lifeline by two of his victims.
jessica kensky and patrick downes , who lost limbs in the 2013 marathon , today opposed the death penalty as a means of punishment for their attacker , urging others to ' overcome the impulse for vengeance.
' the couple 's statement of compassion follows a similar appeal made by the family of an eight - year - old boy , martin richard , who was killed in the blast.
this week , after finding tsaernaev guilty on all 30 counts related to the april 15 , 2013 , attack , a jury will decide whether to sentence dzhokar tsarnaev to death or life in prison without parole
