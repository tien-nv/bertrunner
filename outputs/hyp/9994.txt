a population of wild wood bison were successfully reintroduced to the united states to freely roam the plains of alaska for the first time in over a century.
the moment was captured on video and shows alaska department of fish and game biologist tom seaton leading 100 wood bison to freedom on a snowmobile.
the land mammals were freed from a temporary pen , where they had been kept for just over a week during the transition , and followed mr tom seaton to their new home.
wood bison are north america âs largest land mammal , but the native alaska species disappeared from the state more than 100 years ago
