genetic analysis of two woolly mammoth remains show that their population became so small that they had become chronically inbred.
the study has also raised the prospect of bringing the giant mammal back to life using cloning techniques with modern elephants.
scientists claim to have taken a major step towards recreating the woolly mammoth by inserting more than a dozen of the creature 's genes into the live dna of an elephant.
researchers studied the structure of dna from mammoths preserved in the arctic to reproduce exact copies of 14 of the extinct animal âs genes
