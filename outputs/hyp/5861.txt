ed miliband 's proposed change in the rules on ' non-doms ' would cost britain billions , experts warned last night.
the labour leader announced plans to overhaul britain 's non-domicile regime , which allows 116,000 foreigners and people with foreign links to pay tax only on money that they bring into britain.
