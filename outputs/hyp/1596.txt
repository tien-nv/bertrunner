a greedy mother who told a 13 - year - old volunteer to ' f * * * off ' was evicted from a family easter egg hunt after she took more than her fair share of chocolate treats.
the woman in her mid- to late 30s , who is believed to have had two or three children participating , was at melbourne âs greatest ever easter egg hunt , which was run by zaidee 's rainbow foundation at caulfield racecourse on saturday.
she was escorted out of the racecourse , in melbourne 's south - east , when she became ' irate ' after a young volunteer at the hunt asked her to stop taking so many easter eggs.
she was told by a 13 - year - old volunteer she was taking too many eggs and she told the young person to ' f * * * off ' the woman kept denying she was smuggling eggs into additional plastic bags she had brought in ' parents are the toughest ones to control
