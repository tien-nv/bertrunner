benaud made commentary look easy.
i had the great honour of doing a stint on channel 9 in australia during an ashes test a few years ago.
they âd only recently introduced the concept of using three commentators in one go and , as usual , benaud was keeping his contributions to a minimum.
anyway , benaud had noticed something out in the middle and flicked what we call the lazy switch , so he could have a quiet word with the producer without the viewers hearing him
