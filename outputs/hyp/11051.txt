shelling began to boom through the yemen city of aden on thursday afternoon as we hurried back to board the boat that had brought us here from djibouti.
how we got to yemen : 30 dangerous hours in a boat saudi began airstrikes on houthi rebels in yemen three weeks ago thursday.
but aden remains a city not fully in the hands either of houthi rebels or forces loyal to the ousted government of president hadi.
the houthi forced hadi from power in january , though hadi still claims to be yemen 's legitimate leader and is working with the saudi and other allies to return to yemen
