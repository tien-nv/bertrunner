when gareth let his five friends plan a stag do , he might have imagined it would involve pranks , costumes and drinking - but denim hotpants and heels were far from his thoughts.
little did he realise his friends from cwmbran , south wales , were inspired by the hilarious money supermarket advert , featuring a man dressed in shirt and jacket from the waist up and tight booty shorts and stilettos from the waist down.
when the men in their matching outfits walked down the street in benidorm , spanish , they earned cheers , clapping and even policemen driving past waved and laughed.
