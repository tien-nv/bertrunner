the flag - burning father of a runaway britain jihadi schoolgirl yesterday admitted taking his daughter to an extremist rally when she was 13.
hussen â who blamed police for failing to stop his daughter fleeing to join is earlier this year â conceded the teenager was â maybe â influenced by the rally organised by banned terror group al-muhajiroun.
mr hussen told mps last month , after his daughter amira abase fled to syria aged 15 , that he could think of â nothing â to explain why she and two friends had decided to join is , as well as keeping quiet about his own links to radicalism.
also at the rally were hate cleric anjem choudary and michael adebowale , one of the killers of fusilier lee rigby
