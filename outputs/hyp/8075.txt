it is seen as extremely rude in most human societies , but it appears apes also use whispers to pass on information they do not want others to hear.
gibbons - better known for their deafening songs that reverberate around the forests they inhabit - have been found to regularly use the secretive form of communication.
the apes , which are found in the forest of south east asia , produce a variety of soft call types , known as ' hoos ' , that are almost inaudible to the human ear.
the researchers found that predator ' hoos ' in particular were produced at frequencies well below the threshold of hearing for eagles and other birds of prey
