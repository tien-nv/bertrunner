a landmark ruling on piracy and privacy on the internet means thousands of australian could be getting letters threatening legally action if they illegally downloaded and shared hollywood film dallas buyers club.
but internet law experts say the company behind the letters will have a hard time following through on the threats because it is very difficult to prove who is legally responsible for the downloading.
the federal court ruled on tuesday that australian internet companies , including iinet and other isps , should hand over the names and residential addresses of 4,726 people who illegally shared the film.
iinet 's former chief regulatory officer , dalby , said the letter was not proof and it would be difficult for the film 's studio to prove someone downloaded it
