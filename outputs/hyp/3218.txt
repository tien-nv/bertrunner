prehistoric humans living in a cave 14,700 years ago were cannibals and made cups from the skulls of the dead , a new study has found.
researchers at the natural history museum in london and university college london have found evidence that the human bones found in gough 's cave in somerset had the flesh cut from them before being chewed and crushed.
they found tooth marks on many of the bones , which were discovered in the cave during excavations between 1880 and 1992.
the archaeologists behind the study say the findings suggest people living in the late ice age indulged in ritual cannibalism , perhaps as a macabre way to revere their dead kin
