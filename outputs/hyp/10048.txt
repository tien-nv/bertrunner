president obama has ordered the release of 22 drug dealers - including eight who were serving life sentences.
nearly all of the offenders who obama granted clemency to were convicted of dealing addictive , hard drugs like crack cocaine , methamphetamine and heroin.
eight of those whose sentences were commuted - an act the white house said continues obama 's push to make the justice system fairer - were serving terms of life in prison.
the effort is aimed at reducing harsh sentences for those who faced outdated guidelines at their time of sentencing and would be serving shorter punishments had they been convicted today
