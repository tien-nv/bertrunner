an elderly couple have been charged as investigations deepen into the discovery of a mass dog grave containing the carcasses of 55 greyhounds.
the 71 - year - old man and 64 - year - old woman were charged with unlawfully possessing a firearm after a police search found a rifle and ammunition in a home in bundaberg on thursday.
