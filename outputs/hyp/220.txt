a second spectacular blast from the calbuco volcano in southern chile has covered nearby towns and villages in a thick layer of ash.
the first eruption in over four decades yesterday sent vast clouds of dust more than six miles into the air , creating an incredible display of lightning and lava against the night 's sky.
another unexpected eruption in the los lagos region today heightened fears of local waters becoming contaminated , residents developing severe breathing problems and more flights being grounded.
the ash covered cars and houses in cities as far as 18 miles away from the source of the eruption as another massive evacuation effort gets underway
