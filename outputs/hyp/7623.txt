a man who fled to africa in the hope of a better life has been brutally murdered by a mob who are believed to have attacked him purely because he came from mozambique.
shocking images capture the moment the armed gang surround sithole and repeatedly stab him with knives and bludgeon him with a wrench in alexandra township near johannesburg.
in a chilling twist the victim was left bleeding to death in a gutter because a medical centre just 300 feet away was closed for the day because the doctor who worked there was also a foreigner and feared becoming a victim of a xenophobic attack himself.
doctors tried in vain to save mr sithole 's life
