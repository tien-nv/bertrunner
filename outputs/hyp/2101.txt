an informant who spent the last 27 years working for the dea as an undercover operative in exchange for the promise of us citizenship says he 'll be deported now that he has retired.
toro , 66 , worked as a mid-level member of the medellin cartel in the 1980s when a confrontation with his boss caused him to flee from colombia fearing for his life.
toro came to the us and eventually began working for the dea as an informant after providing information about a number of his former bosses and associates.
that has not happened and toro is now technically living in the us illegally after declining health forced him to retire , according to the florida center for investigative reporting
