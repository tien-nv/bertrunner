late one night on facebook , a girl with cystic fibrosis messaged a boy with cystic fibrosis , and both their lives were changed forever.
the girl , katie , read that the boy , dalton , was very sick.
cystic fibrosis patients should n't be near each other because they can share infections that could cripple their already fragile lungs.
dr. anstead at the university of kentucky , katie 's pulmonologist since she was a little girl , had lectured her many times that face - to - face meetings with other cf patients were a bad idea
