the justices of the scotus practice politics as much as law -- and that will be clearer than ever when the issue of same - sex marriage comes before the court on tuesday.
public opinion on same - sex marriage has turned upside down since the supreme judicial court in massachusetts first legalized the practice in 2003.
of course , the constitution has not changed since 2003 , a point that will surely be made by such opponents of same - sex marriage as justice scalia.
to originalists like scalia -- those who believe the constitution should be interpreted only as it was originally understood by the framers -- the idea of a constitutional right to same - sex marriage is anathema
