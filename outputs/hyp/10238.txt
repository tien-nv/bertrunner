underlining a change across the nation , nearly 90per cent of americans adults now say they have health insurance , according to an extensive survey released monday.
researchers behind the gallup-healthways well-being index say the number of uninsured americans is now at a record low.
when tracking began in 2008 roughly 14per cent of citizens were uninsured , peaking at 18per cent in the third quarter of 2013.
whether the new findings turn out to be a high - water mark for president obama 's health care law , or a milestone on the path toward his goal of getting virtually all americans residents covered , remains to be seen
