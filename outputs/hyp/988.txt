the london borough of barking and dagenham wants dog owners to pick up their pets ' droppings and use bins provided a london council is to introduce csi - style dna testing for dogs so it can track and fine owners who do n't clean up after their animals.
the london borough of barking and dagenham wants dog owners to submit a dna sample from the inside of the animal 's cheek so it is registered on a database.
the council would then use stored information to match the animal responsible with any errant mess found on the streets - and issue the owner an Â£ 80 fine.
the council hopes that the collection of dna samples would fit well with new national laws requiring all owners in uk to microchip their dogs by april next year
