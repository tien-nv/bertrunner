three more of hillary clinton 's ' everyday americans ' have been revealed to have strong links to the democrat party - including one who could be set to support a rival bid for the white house.
julie stauch and married couple sean bagniewski and reddy all appear in on the video announcing clinton 's 2016 bid.
they are part of a diverse group of people - from young mothers and people preparing for retirement , to spanish - speaking brothers preparing to start a business and an asian - american college graduate looking for her first job - chosen to show aspirational citizens as clinton looks to speak to to wide demographic of voters.
' but far from being ' everyday americans ' , as the two minute video claims , julie stauch and sean bagniewski are directly involved with the democrat party - just like campaigners milrad and johnson , from chicago , illinois , who discuss their upcoming wedding plans on screen
