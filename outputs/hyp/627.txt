hernandez made it six goals in eight starts as real kept up their pursuit of barcelona at the top of la liga with a 4 - 2 win over celta vigo.
hernandez is currently scoring a goal every 83 minutes with a scoring ratio that is only two minutes short of lionel messi who nets once every 81 minutes.
the manchester united loanee put his team in the champions league semi-finals in midweek with the winner against atletico madrid and in baliados on sunday night he scored twice to keep real in the title race.
and if his goal at the bernabeu was a tired shot with the goal gaping in the dying minutes , his strikes against celta vigo were of the highest quality and will only serve to ramp up the auction for his services at the end of the season â who knows if his goals bring trophies to the santiago bernabeu , real might even be in the race to sign him permanently
