we all need a helping hand sometimes , and nobody more so than kecil the baby orangutan , who had a tough start to life after his natural mother and another surrogate mother rejected him.
but the one - year - old ape found love at the third time of asking with second surrogate mother maggie at chicago 's brookfield zoo , and has today been pictured cuddling up to the experienced mother ahead of his first public outing this weekend.
maggie , 53 , who has already raised one surrogate child , has proved herself yet again by helping to raise kecil ( pronounced ka-cheel ) for the past 10 months , and the two now have an inseparable bond.
in a final attempt to find a parent for kecil , he was handed over to maggie , the oldest orangutan in north america , who has already raised four children of her own , and a fifth surrogate which was given to her in 2002
