police are investigating links between the hatton garden gems heist and a strikingly similar raid on a berlin bank two years ago.
german detectives have been â closely monitoring developments â in the Â£ 60 million london case and are expected to make contact with scotland yard this week.
in particular , they are keen to find out whether any dna was recovered from the scene of the easter weekend raid and , crucially , whether it matches forensic samples found in a tunnel used in a Â£ 8.3 million robbery at the volksbank in steglitz , berlin , in january 2013.
the culprits behind the hatton garden raid ( pictured ) may have carried out a similarly audacious burglary just two years earlier in berlin , it has emerged in a case which has strikingly similar traits to the Â£ 60m heist in london , thieves targeted 294 security vaults during a break - in at the volksbank in steglitz , berlin , in january 2013 there has been speculation that the london robbers â who stole jewels and cash from 72 boxes at the hatton garden safe deposit centre â are from eastern europe
