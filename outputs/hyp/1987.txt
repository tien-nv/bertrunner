newcastle united boss carver accepts the pressure is on as his side head into their final six games with their top - flight status still not secured.
the magpies slipped to a fifth successive barclays premier league defeat at liverpool on monday , a result that did little to ease fears they could yet be sucked into relegation trouble.
newcastle remain in the relative safety of 13th place with 35 points but the sides below them have been eating into their cushion.
they are nine points above the relegation zone but with some awkward - looking games in their run - in , including this weekend 's home clash with tottenham and matches against fellow battlers leicester , west brom and queens park rangers
