one company is offering the chance to dive 12,500ft below the surface of the sea to explore the ship at the bottom of the atlantic.
the tour takes in sights like the famous grand staircase , the ship 's huge anchors and the marconi room , from which the world 's very first sos was broadcast.
the once - in - a - lifetime privilege is being offered by luxury concierge service , bluefish , and does not come cheap , setting you back a whopping Â£ 41,000 ( $ 60,000 )
