miliband today rushed to scottish to try to shore up his hope of becoming prime minister as a damning poll showed almost half of scottish are ready to back the snp.
the labour leader used a speech in edinburgh to claim the tories election campaign has descended into ' desperation and panic ' , as some polls put labour ahead across the united kingdom.
but mr miliband has been rocked by a survey showing that in scottish , 49 per cent of people plan to vote for the snp , with just 25 per cent backing labour , robbing him of any possibility of an overall majority.
the new yougov poll for the times shows labour is down four points on last month to their lowest level since the survey began in 2007
