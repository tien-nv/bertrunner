a food supplier for supermarket giant tesco has sacked a farm worker who was caught on camera urinating in a field of vegetables.
a disgusted member of the public snapped the man on his mobile phone after spotting him using the field as a makeshift toilet.
the worker , who can be seen in a high - vis jacket , casually stood in the middle of the crops urinating on the plants - despite a toilet being only 18 metres away.
