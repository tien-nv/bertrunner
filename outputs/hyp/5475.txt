pamela anderson has come in for criticism for her very public show of support for an arizona sheriff notorious for his controversial opinions and racial profiling of latinos.
arpaio , who calls himself â america âs toughest sheriff â , and the former baywatch star appeared odd soul - mates as they joined together at the maricopa county jail on wednesday to promote the benefits of an all - vegetarian diet.
arpaio says cutting meat from the meals served to the more than 8,000 inmates has saved an estimated $ 200,000 per year.
anderson , a longtime vegan and a spokeswoman for the animal rights group peta , said she hopes the meal initiative stands as a model for prisons and jails across the country
