the australia government has won its bid to ban the boss of the nation 's biggest bikie gang from australia after the federal court ruled unanimously against vella re-entering the country.
three federal court judges ruled that vella , 61 - who is regularly described as a millionaire businessman - be prohibited from returning after the government cancelled the rebels bikie gang president 's visa while he was overseas in his native malta last year.
in a judgement obtained by daily mail australia , the court this week ordered vella , who has painted himself as a nelson mandela - like figure and sold stubby holders and t - shirts to fund his legal battle , pay all court costs.
the decision strands vella in malta , leaving behind in australia 24 close family members including a wife , sons and an elderly mother , all of whom are australia citizens
