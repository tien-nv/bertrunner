murray reckons a supposedly easier run - in can swing second place hibs ' way ahead of rangers in the last month of the scottish championship season.
but while stuart mccall 's men have the momentum at present - beating hibs and cowdenbeath while alan stubbs ' men also lost to raith-murray would n't be surprised to see the balance of power swing back towards easter road before long.
dumbarton boss murray believes that rangers will struggle to maintain their pace through the run - in rangers - currently level on points but having played a game less - still have two matches to play against title winners hearts , including sunday 's match at ibrox , while the leith side take on their city rivals just once more.
hibs : april 4 queen of the south ( h ) ; april 8 dumbarton ( a ) ; april 12 hearts ( h ) ; april 22 livingston ( a ) ; april 25 alloa ( h ) ; may 2 falkirk ( a ) rangers : april 5 hearts ( h ) ; april 9 queen of the south ( a ) ; april 12 raith ( h ) ; april 15 livingston ( a ) ; april 18 dumbarton ( a ) ; april 25 falkirk ( h ) ; may 2 hearts ( a ) ' rangers got a good result against cowdenbeath last saturday to keep themselves in contention and i think it 's going to be close but i still believe hibs have the easier run - in , ' said murray
