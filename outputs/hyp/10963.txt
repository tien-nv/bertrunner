sunday 's announcement that corinthian would shut down all of its remaining 28 campuses is a positive development in a long struggle to hold for - profit colleges accountable.
corinthian , which once enrolled more than 70,000 students , is one of the worst of the " predator colleges " -- schools that offer dubious degrees , saddle students with high amounts of debt and gobble up tens of billions of dollars in federal money every year.
it 's no wonder that corinthian is doing this after the united states education department curtailed its access to federal student aid last summer.
there are about 1.3 million students enrolled in for - profit colleges , many of which have questionable track records , and their students need help transitioning into legitimate postsecondary schools
