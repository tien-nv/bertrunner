firefighters were forced to chisel through a brick wall to free a pet cat who became stuck upside down in between a tiny gap in two garages.
grey and white cat marv somehow managed to get wedged in a five inch gap in between owner veale 's garage and his neighbours in hanham , bristol and was left dangling for two hours.
the rspca were called and they too were unable to coax the pet from the gap and eventually firefighters had to tunnel through a garage wall with a chisel to get him free.
firefighters spent half an hour chiselling a breezeblock free from the neighbour 's wall , revealing marv 's tail and back legs so mr coombs could pull him out backwards
