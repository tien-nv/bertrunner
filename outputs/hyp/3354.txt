no - fly list : roberts , a computer security researcher on his way to give a talk about computer security vulnerabilities at a major conference was told he could n't fly on united airlines saturday , due to comments he 'd made on tweet united airlines stopped a prominent security researcher from boarding a california - bound flight late saturday , following a social media post by the researcher days earlier suggesting the airline 's onboard systems could be hacked.
the researcher , roberts , attempted to board a united airlines flight from colorado to san francisco to speak at a major security conference there this week , but was stopped by the airline 's corporate security at the gate.
roberts had been removed from a united airlines flight on wednesday by the fbi after landing in syracuse , new york , and was questioned for four hours after jokingly suggesting on tweet he could get the oxygen masks on the plane to deploy.
a lawyer for roberts said united airlines gave him no detailed explanation on saturday why he was n't allowed on the plane , saying instead the airline would be sending roberts a letter within two weeks stating why they would n't let him fly on their aircraft
