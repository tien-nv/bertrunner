a single bikini - clad woman silhouetted against a spectacular sunset , a tiny figure facing a swirl of stars , a hot spring whose improbably lurid hues seem like something from another planet - these stunning images combine colour and light to capture the wonders of the natural world.
last year hawaiian - born photographer dustin wong , 31 , abandoned his job as an engineer to travel the world with only his camera for company.
inspired by ancient hawaiian beliefs in the sacredness of the landscape , dustin wong , 31 , has journeyed from the arctic circle to queensland , capturing moments where men and women are alone with the power and splendour of the natural world.
this single bikini - clad woman stretches her curvaceous body while silhouetted against a spectacular hawaiian sunset faced with the rapid destruction of habitats through pollution and overpopulation , the photographer hopes his images will inspire the viewer with awe at the intricate and diverse world we live in and encourage them to protect the planet
