alastair cook may have had a long break working on his batting with his old mentor graham gooch but his technical problems very much remain.
the england captain , without an international century for almost two years , failed for the second time in the first test as his old failing against the full ball just outside off - stump was again exploited by west indies.
to compound alastair cook âs misery , there was also another failure for jonathan trott , who has endured a nightmare return to the england team for his 50th test , 18 months after the trauma of leaving the ashes tour following his 49th.
the double blow at the start of england âs second innings left them with much to do in this first test to work their way towards a winning position at the sir viv richards stadium even though they earned a first - innings lead of 104
