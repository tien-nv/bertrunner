johnson last night urged ukip voters to ' swing behind the tory ' to avoid the ' nightmare ' of a ' backward - looking labour government ' propped up by an ' even more left - wing ' snp.

any gain by ukip is a gain by ed miliband , ' he told the daily mail as he campaigned in the thanet , the kent seat where mr nigel farage is standing.
mr johnson 's intervention signals that the tories are determined to ramp up their warnings over a minority labour government dependent on the votes of snp mps
