the arizona police officer who slammed into an armed suspect with his patrol car told investigators he thought he was too far to take a shot at the man , so he chose the other option , cnn affiliate kvoa reported wednesday.
officer rapiejko ran his car into mario valencia in february as the suspect carried a rifle he had just fired in the air.
rapiejko sped around another officer as valencia walked through a business park , hit the man from behind with the left side of his front bumper.
valencia , who flew through this air , survived and faces more than a dozen charges for an alleged crime spree that day
