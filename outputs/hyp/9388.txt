whatever caused small space rocks to lump together billions of years ago , magnetism is unlikely to be the reason.
scientists announced today that measurements made by the european space probe philae , which landed on comet 67p in november , show the comet 's core is n't magnetised.
a composite of 18 images showing off the comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko activity from different angles as seen between 31 january ( top left ) and 25 march ( bottom right ) , when the spacecraft was at distances of about 30 to 100 km from the comet but in a paper published online by the journal science , the team led by auster at the technical university of braunschweig , germany , said their data â which benefited from three unexpected bounces that allowed philae to collect more results than planned â do n't support this theory.
' if comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko is representative of all cometary nuclei , then we suggest that magnetic forces are unlikely to have played a role in the accumulation of planetary building blocks greater than one meter ( 3 feet ) in size
