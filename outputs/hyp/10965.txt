washington as the national guard prepared to deploy to help quell riots in ferguson , missouri , that raged sporadically last year , the guard used highly militarized words such as " enemy forces " and " adversaries " to refer to protesters , according to documents obtained by cnn.
the guard came to ferguson to support law enforcement officers , whom many community leaders and civil rights activists accused of using excessive force and inflaming an already tense situation in protests that flared sporadically from august through the end of the year.
the national guard 's language , contained in internal mission briefings obtained through a freedom of information act request , is intensifying the concerns of some who objected to the police officers ' actions in putting down riots.
the documents obtained by cnn also detail that the national guard was concerned about perceptions of its deployment , with superiors later telling troops to stop using heavily militarized language to describe protesters
