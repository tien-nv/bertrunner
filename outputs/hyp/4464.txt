almost three years after nearly leaving liverpool henderson has committed his long - term future to the club convinced he can win silverware at anfield.
late in the summer of 2012 , just a couple of months into the reign of rodgers , he was lined up as makeweight in a failed bid to sign fulham 's clint dempsey only for the midfielder to reject the move.
his determination to prove himself , and justify the Â£ 16million price tag which came with him from sunderland the previous summer , has been rewarded not only with a new five - year Â£ 100,000 - a - week contract but with the prospect of him taking over the captain 's armband from steven gerrard when he leaves for the los angeles galaxy at the end of the season.
henderson is ' over the moon ' after signing a new long - term contract with liverpool the club 's vice-captain puts pen to paper on a deal which will keep him at liverpool until 2020 henderson has enjoyed a strong campaign and could be handed the armband when steven gerrard leaves but it is the unfulfilled potential which persuaded the 24 - year - old england international to commit what should be the best years of his career to the club
