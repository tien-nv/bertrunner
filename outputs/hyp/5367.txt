rare and valuable pieces of meteorite have fallen to earth from a gigantic fireball that lit up the skies over uk and ireland , experts say.
the fireball was captured on camera on sunday by the uk meteor observing network ( ukmon ) in portadown , county armagh.
david moore from astronomy ireland told the mirror : ' this event was so bright that a piece or pieces may have survived the re-entry and landed as extremely rare and valuable meteorites.
' it added that the meteorite was burning at a very low altitude of 21 miles , compared to the usual 50 to 75 miles and was formed of ' very hard and dense material compared to soft cometary material which we normally see as meteor showers '
