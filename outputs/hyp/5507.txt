lerner will attend aston villa âs fa cup final against arsenal after missing the victory over liverpool at wembley because of a family bereavement.
aston villa chief executive fox said the american owner was delighted by the 2 - 1 win and upset he had not been able to make the trip across the atlantic.
fox , who sacked paul lambert and hired tim sherwood , said the result can get rid of the doom and gloom that hung around the club.
he backed aston villa to have a chance of beating his old club arsenal , where he was commercial director until last summer , on may 30
