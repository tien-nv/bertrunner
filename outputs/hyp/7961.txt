scientist fergus simpson has calculated the minimum size needed for intelligent life to survive , based on the laws of conservation of energy seen on earth.
and from this , he calculates that if intelligent extraterrestrials exist they will typically weigh 650lbs ( 300kg ) - the median weight of a polar bear.
fergus simpson from university of barcelona applied a mathematical formula to assume aliens obey the same laws of conservation of energy as animals on earth mr fergus simpson came to this conclusion by applying a mathematical formula that assumes aliens obey the same laws of conservation of energy as animals do on earth.
and , if they exist , he believes intelligent aliens typically weigh more than 650 lbs ( 300kg ) - around the size of a polar bear ( stock image ) his argument follows that if clever aliens are large , there may be fewer of them , as they will likely live in a society with low population densities to ensure they have the resources they need
