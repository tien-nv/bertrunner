the daughter of chicago socialite wiese-mack accused of brutally murdering her mother during a bali vacation will turn over a ' significant percentage ' of her $ 1.3million trust fund to care for her newborn daughter.
favia , attorney for 19 - year - old heather mack , has filed court documents for her client agreeing to turn over funds for the care of four - month - old stella.
