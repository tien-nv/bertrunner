genealogists have made an error in compiling the family tree of clinton and she is in fact linked to a poor welsh mining family , an expert claimed as she kicks off her bid to enter the white house , clinton could claim that her path to the presidency began some 160 years ago in the little - known welsh parish of ystradyfodwg â if she can pronounce it , that is.
for while the us democrat has previously spoken of her british ancestry , a definitive family tree has revealed her links to a poor mining community in the welsh valleys.
ystradyfodwg , pronounced ust - rady - vod - ug , was the home of mrs clinton 's great grandmother - a woman who showed a determination , similar to that of the former first lady , to struggle through poverty and eventually emigrate to us with her family.
in fact mrs clinton 's steely resolve to get to the white house and make history as the first female president , can be seen in the actions of her female ancestors , who even defied social conventions through the years
