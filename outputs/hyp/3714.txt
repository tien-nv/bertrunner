a beanie believed to have belonged to luke has been found on the fourth day of the search for the missing 11 - year - old.
victorian police have confirmed it was located on monday afternoon , west of the devil âs cove and candlebark campsite in lake eildon - north - east of melbourne.
it is understood he wandered off and has not been seen since police remain hopeful they will find the boy who went missing from the campsite on friday.
on sunday , search co-ordinator acting senior sergeant andrew walker said luke had a ' very high pain tolerance ' , a factor that would work in his favour given he has now been missing for days
