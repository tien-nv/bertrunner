mothers and babies have been banned from special screenings at an independent cinema after staff became fed up with clearing away dirty nappies and oversized prams.
the manager of the rex cinema in berkhamsted , hertfordshire , cancelled the regular tuesday baby matinees due to a combination of ' whingeing , bitching , snitching and the law '.
hannaway , who restored and reopened the traditional cinema in 2004 , announced the decision on the company 's website.
mr hannaway said he was fed up with the whingeing from those attending the screenings without babies , even though they declared they ' might contain babies '
