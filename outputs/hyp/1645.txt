my first trip to new york was with my aunt when i was about 18 and i had been appearing in coronation street for about 12 months.
we had a lot of fun together - we went to see the musical chicago on broadway and did lots and lots of shopping.
we returned to the city that never sleeps in january 2001 , eight months before the terrible events of 9/11 , and one of the first things my boyfriend sylvain longchambon and i did on my latest trip was to visit the site of the world trade center to see the monument to those who died.
coronation street star samia ghadie and boyfriend sylvain longchambon take a selfie in new york there were hundreds of people visiting the memorial at the time but everybody was quiet and extremely respectful
