dementia could soon be treated with a ' brain pacemaker ' inserted directly into the skull , according to new research.
scientists have shown that using deep brain stimulation ( dbs ) , a technique already used to treat parkinson 's disease , can boost memory by causing new brain cells to be formed.
a ' pacemaker ' fitted with electrodes is inserted into the brain through holes drilled in the skull.
deep brain stimulation is already used to treat parkinson 's , but now researchers now believe it could be used to improve brain function and ward off diseases such as dementia ( file image ) experiments on rats found the therapy improved their powers of recall , and it is hoped the same will apply to humans
