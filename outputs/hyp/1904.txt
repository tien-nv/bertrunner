a canadian woman whose son died fighting for the islamic state is now working to stop the extremist group from taking advantage of more vulnerable young men and women in north america.
boudreau thought her son damien was going to egypt to study arabic in 2013 , but canadian authorities later told the calgary mother that her son had instead gone to turkey where he crossed the border into syria to join isis.
while damien had become more extreme in his islam ideology before he left canadian , ms boudreau never imagined her shy and peaceful son would actually become a jihadi.
