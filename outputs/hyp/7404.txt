as of april 1 , the licensing system for agents is to change so that anyone can become a football agent as long as they pay Â£ 500 for an initial one - year registration period.
the fa is due to place a link on their website for intermediaries to register , but as of 1pm that was still not in place.
mel stein thinks the new regulations on becoming a football agent will ' create anarchy ' the new guidelines have come in after fifa effectively washed their hands of governing agents.
fifa recommendations include national associations registering only intermediaries of ' impeccable character ' , all deals annually published online , agents ' fees limited to three per cent and no monies earned by them for negotiating deals for players under the age of 18
