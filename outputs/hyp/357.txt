benik afobe âs first - half finish kept wolves slim dreams of promotion alive and helped push 10 - man wigan to the brink of relegation after a tense clash at the dw stadium.
benik afobe popped up unmarked early on to bundle home and the result leaves wigan on the verge of dropping into english football âs third - tier after a dreadful season.
to make matters worse , the latics will have to face brentford next weekend without star man james mcclean who received his marching orders in injury - time for a second bookable offence.
