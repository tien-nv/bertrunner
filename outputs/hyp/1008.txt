simon calvert of the christian says forcing teachers to promote gay relationships would be making them choose between their faith and their job schools should be forced to promote gay relationships in sex education lessons , union leaders say.
the national union of teachers has called for a â positive portrayal of same sex relationships â in lessons to be made â compulsory â under the next government.
it said mps had a duty to tackle â homophobia , biphobia and transphobia â in schools and create a â positive climate of understanding about sexuality â.
but critics accused the national union of teachers of â thought control â and said the â intolerant â proposals risked â oversexualising â children at a young age
