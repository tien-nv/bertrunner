in the heart of yellowstone , a supervolcano releases around 45,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide each day.
but the magma chamber lying directly beneath its surface is not considered large enough to produce such levels , so researchers have been searching for an alternative source for years.
now , by tracking seismic waves , a team of geophysicists has discovered an enormous secondary chamber deeper underground that 's so large its partly - molten rock could fill the grand canyon 11 times over.
a magma chamber beneath the surface is not considered large enough to produce these levels and now researchers have found the source in a secondary magma chamber deeper underground the yellowstone supervolcano is one of the largest active continental silicic volcanic fields in the world
