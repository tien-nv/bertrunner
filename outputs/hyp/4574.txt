former leeds captain cherry has branded the six leeds players who withdrew at short notice from saturday 's match against charlton a ' disgrace ' and called for them to be sacked by the club.
italian quartet antenucci , giuseppe bellusci , dario del fabro and silvestri , frenchman souleymane doukara and albanian edgar cani all told beleaguered head coach neil redfearn they were injured and could not travel to london.
neil redfearn , speaking after his side lost 2 - 1 at the valley , described it as a ' freakish ' set of events.
according to the manager , silvestri had been rested since sustaining a knock but had been expected to recover , while antenucci and canu declared themselves unfit after training on thursday with the rest pulling out following a ' light ' session on friday
