this week , social media heralded as # motheroftheyear toya graham , the baltimore single mom who pulled her son , who was holding a brick , away from the scene of a riot.
a video of graham yanking young michael from a group of protesters -- and subsequently pummeling him with her fists and a few slaps upside the head -- went viral.
is n't violence at home what leads to violence outside the home ? is n't this why rioting happens ? i 'm not excusing violence in any form.
but baltimore is n't on fire because of mothers like graham
