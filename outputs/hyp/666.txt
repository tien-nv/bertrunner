barca threw away a two - goal lead against sevilla thanks to individual errors by bravo and gerard pique , which leaves them just two points ahead of real madrid at the top of la liga.
it was a cruel twist of fate for bravo and gerard pique , both of whom have been outstanding in the second half of the season and the effort on sevilla 's part was momentous.
a year ago barca travelled to andalusia to face granada and left a beaten side , their title challenge hitting an iceberg.
