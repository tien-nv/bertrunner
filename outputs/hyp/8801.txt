the son of a labour councillor who was detained in turkish after apparently trying to sneak into syria with eight family members was seen grinning as he began his journey back to uk.
waheed ahmed , 21 , who is the son of rochdale politician shakil ahmed , was arrested with eight relatives â including four children â in a remote turkish border town earlier this month.
however , it is understood he is now returning to the uk and will fly from dalaman into manchester later this evening.
the majority of the family flew to turkish on march 27 from manchester and are accused of having plans to try and sneak across the border into syria
