nine of ten mostly foreign prisoners on death row in indonesia have been given 72 hours notice ahead of their execution , according to a spokesperson for the attorney general 's office.
though indonesia officials said all 10 would be executed at the same time , spontana said french national serge atlaoui had filed a challenge to the state administrative court on thursday so his sentence has been delayed.
meanwhile , edre olalia , a lawyer acting for philippines maid veloso , told cnn sunday that veloso had telephoned her sister on saturday at about 5:30 p.m. local time and said her execution will take place on tuesday , april 28.
on friday , indonesia officials advised relevant consular officials to travel to indonesia 's " execution island " -- nusa kambangan -- where the ten are being held -- a sign that the sentences may be carried out soon
