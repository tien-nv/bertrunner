virtual reality headsets could help to tackle air sickness and jet lag during flights , according to a team of british engineers.
a new device , called the vr , provides passengers with a virtual image of the horizon that mimics the movements of the aircraft.
this can help to combat the conflict between the information coming from a person 's eyes and their sense of balance in the inner ear , which can lead to travel sickness.
the system , designed by in - flight entertainment company flow flow ife , can also present travellers with high quality images of their destination that replicate the time of day to help them acclimatise to their new time zone
