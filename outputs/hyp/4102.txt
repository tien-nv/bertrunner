the red cross hopes to bring vital medical supplies and aid workers into yemen after receiving approval from the saudi - led military coalition , an icrc spokeswoman said.
the aid agency has been negotiating for a week to deliver life - saving supplies and equipment to yemen , where the coalition has conducted 11 days of air strikes against iran - backed houthis.
the un last week said that more than 500 people had been killed in two weeks of fighting in yemen.
but hopes of getting aid into the country by tomorrow are fading , as they seek clearance from arab states waging the air strikes and hunt for planes prepared to fly to yemen
