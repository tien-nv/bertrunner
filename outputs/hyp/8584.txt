and now the â kate effect â has put a bump in the profits of british fashion house seraphine.
kate wore the natasha coat to a series of engagements in kensington in january and it instantly became such a hit with women â many of whom were nât even pregnant â that it sold out in most sizes.
other seraphine outfits in the kate âs wardrobe include the Â£ 46 fuchsia wrap dress that she wore in the first official photograph of prince george nearly two years ago
