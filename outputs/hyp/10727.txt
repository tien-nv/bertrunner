isis operatives have executed two groups of prisoners , believed to be ethiopian christians , in southern libya , according to a video released sunday by the terror network 's media arm.
the ethiopian government confirmed monday that 30 of its citizens were among the two groups , according to the ethiopian news agency.
the al - furqan media video -- which is highly produced and titled " until there came to them clear evidence " -- shows two groups of men , one in orange jumpsuits and the other in black , being killed at different locations in southern libya , according to the video 's narrator.
earlier in the video , a different speaker says christians in the northern iraqi city of mosul were given the choice to embrace islam or maintain their syrian christian faith and pay a tax
