istanbul , turkey sitting on a sunny bench in istanbul 's gezi park , gurgen dismisses the controversy surrounding the 100th anniversary friday of the massacre of armenian under the ottoman empire with a wave of her hand.
gurgen , a 55 - year - old cleaner , says her family has had close friendships with armenian going back generations.
ninety - one percent of turks do not believe that the events of 1915 -- when , according to armenian , 1.5 million ethnic armenian were systematically killed in the final years of the ottoman empire -- were genocide , according to a recent poll.
it 's a sentiment shared by the turkish government , which denies that a genocide took place , maintaining that hundreds of thousands of turkish muslims and armenian christians died in intercommunal violence around the bloody battlefields of turkey also disputes armenian 's count of the numbers killed , putting it at 300,000
