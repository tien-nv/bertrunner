hudson once called him his ' one true love , ' and now garlington is opening up about his three year relationship with the iconic hollywood actor - and the lengths they went to in order to keep his sexuality a secret.
garlington says he was an extra on a movie set when he first decided to check out hudson , having heard rumors the star was gay , but had to wait an entire year until he heard from the star.
' garlington says he would sneak over to the hudson 's house ( above with friend doris day ) after work , and leave first thing in the morning as for social events , he says the two would just each bring a date so people did not know they were in fact dating.
this lasted for three years , from 1962 until 1965 , and while their sneaking around seemed to work for awhile , hudson became concerned after learning that a female fan had broken into his home as he had photos of garlington , a stockbroker , in his bedside table
