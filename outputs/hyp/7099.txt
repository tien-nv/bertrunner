oskar groening is being tried on 300,000 counts of accessory to murder and faces up to 15 years in jail if convicted an auschwitz survivor who lost 49 family members in the holocaust says the fact that a 93 - year - old former guard at the death camp is on trial is more important than any punishment.
fahidi , who lost her parents and sister , told the luneburg state court today that seeing former ss officer oskar groening in court is ' a kind of satisfaction.
' the 89 - year - old says she could never have imagined she would be testifying before a germany court and that ' for me it 's not about the punishment ' , the dpa news agency reported.
her comments come after another holocaust survivor angered her fellow plaintiffs by forgiving groening - known as the ' bookkeeper of death ' - and said he should not be prosecuted
