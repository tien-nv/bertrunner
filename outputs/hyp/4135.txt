but on thursday night , to celebrate the fifth anniversary of her fight against childhood obesity , obama once again busted some moves , this time on tonight show.
lets disco : obama strutted her stuff on tonight show on thursday night , in a follow - up routine to one they first did in 2013 omg : called the evolution of mom dancing part 2 , the pair pulled some embarrassing ' mom moves ' join in : first lady obama and jimmy fallon took it to the dance floor again during her appearance on tonight show on thursday night oh no you did n't : at the end of the routine , fallon pulled a goofy move he called the ' barack obama ' take this : but obama came back kicking , showing off an equally - awful jive called the ' jimmy fallon ' in dancing up a storm , the two demonstrated some jives they called ' you go girl ' and ' oh my god , i did n't know you were coming here ! ' but when fallon pulled a silly move he called the ' barack obama ' , obama obviously hit back with a terrible take on fallon himself.
during a sit - down with fallon , obama spoke of what she 's achieved in the last five years , and her love of music.
' initiative : lets move ! is an anti-childhood obesity campaign that obama first launched in 2010 however music is n't something she necessarily shares with her daughters , malia , 17 , and sasha , 14
