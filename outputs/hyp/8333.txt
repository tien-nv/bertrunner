over the years i âve been lucky enough to play with a lot of accomplished women golfers , including two former world no 1 's in lorena ochoa and laura davies.
the venue was turnberry and a media day for the ricoh women âs british open in july.
charley hull can make it to the very top of the women 's game if she carries on her progression teenager hull possesses the same â wow â factor as world no 1 rory mcilroy ( below ) one of the nice things for me about playing golf with the women pros is we usually hit the ball about the same length.
