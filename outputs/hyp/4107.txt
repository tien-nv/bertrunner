the captain of a ship that sank off the coast of africa ' started applauding and cheering ' when his vessel was entirely submerged , according to anti-poaching activists who saved the man and his crew.
crew aboard peter hammarstedt vessel bob barker , which had been pursuing the ruined vessel named thunder for 110 days in an effort to stop alleged poaching activities in antarctic waters , found themselves taking on the role of saviours when the boat 's distress signals were sounded.
' what was incredibly strange was that the captain of the thunder , when the vessel did actually sink , started applauding and cheering , which i took to be very unusual behaviour and further evidence that he deliberately sank his own vessel , ' captain peter hammarstedt told fairfax media.
the conservation organisation 's ships collected and delivered to authorities over 72 kilometres of illegal gillnet that it alleges was abandoned by the vessel in december
