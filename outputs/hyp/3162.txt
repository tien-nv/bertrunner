a little boy with autism has sent his toy bear on a round - the - world mission to help him raise awareness about the disability.
in january 2013 , dorian poe , from burlington , ontario , sent his favorite toy out on the global adventure , having been inspired by the story of a cancer - stricken girl who , unable to live her own dreams of world travel , sent her teddy bear in her place.
hoping to raise the same level of global awareness about his own condition , dorian poe decided to send his ganz webkinz bear , called tikko , out into the world , carrying with him a message of understanding and tolerance for those affected by autism.
' when i first decided to support dorian poe in his campaign , it was because i was happy to see him want to â pay it forward â ' christine tells dailymail.com
