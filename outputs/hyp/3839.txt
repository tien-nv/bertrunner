a new hard - hitting campaign is aiming to highlight the misery of homeless women who are unable to access proper sanitary care.
the homeless period project hopes to shred the taboo around females living on the streets and their monthly cycle , and is encouraging people to donate tampons and towels to their local homeless shelter.
a campaign video tells the story of a woman called patricia , who slept rough on the streets of brixton for six months and was forced to use makeshift sanitary products while menstruating.
the trio told femail that they began the campaign as a way of drawing attention to the amount of women who live on the streets after realising that society considered homelessness to be a ' male ' issue
