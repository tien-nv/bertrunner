police ignored the sexual abuse of hundreds of young girls because they were too busy chasing labour crime targets that would earn bonuses for senior staff.
whistleblower brookes , a former detective who tried to investigate the abuse , said money was diverted away from protecting the children from rape , trafficking and beatings in order to pursue so - called â priority crimes â.
now it has emerged the same targets were also linked to performance - related pay for top officers at south yorkshire police.
tory parliamentary candidate michael ellis , a former member of the home affairs select committee , said : â labour âs grossly irresponsible obsession with targets led to a perverted sense of priorities whereby senior officers could get bonuses for prioritising car crime while hundreds of young girls were being abused with impunity
