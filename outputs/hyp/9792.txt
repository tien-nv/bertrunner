isis militants besieging a palestinian refugee camp in syria 's capital have savagely beheaded the leaders of a hamas - linked group opposed to president bashar assad , it has been claimed.
having seized control of up to 90 per cent of the yarmouk camp in south damascus , the jihadis posted gruesome images showing the severed heads of two alleged members of aknaf beit al-maqdis online.
like isis , the palestinian group has declared israel its sworn enemy , although its presence in yarmouk camp has until now been to defend the camp 's 18,000 residents from a crippling two year siege carried out by the bashar assad regime.
isis ' decision to publicly execute the men - as well as reports of the deaths of dozens more palestinian during clashes inside yarmouk camp - has prompted outrage in gaza , where hundreds of furious hamas supporters swore bloody revenge on the terror group during a march yesterday
