baggage handlers at miami international airport have been caught on video as they steal items from passenger luggage.
the miami-dade police department set up a hidden camera to deal with the ongoing problem of luggage theft , and found workers rifling through checked bags both before they were loaded onto planes and once inside the aircraft 's belly.
airline customers have reported $ 2.5million in lost property from 2010 to 2014 ( above a john f. kennedy airport employee ) most shocking however may be how easy it is for airport employees to steal , with only orlando and miami international airport screening employees through metal detectors as they arrive at work and only miami international airport screening them when they leave
