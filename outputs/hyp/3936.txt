friends of murdered indiana university student hannah wilson have said she was last seen at the same bar where lauren spierer partied before she vanished in 2011.
wilson 's body was found in rural brown county , about 10 miles from the campus , on friday morning after a night out.
daniel messel , 49 , was arrested hours later and has been charged in her death.
circumstances of her disappearance are ' eerily similar ' to the case of 20 - year - old spierer , police told fox59 , and they will be looking into the case again
