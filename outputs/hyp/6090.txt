methane , the principle component in natural gas , is usually produced by organic material decomposing.
but there is another form of the deadly gas , dubbed abiotic methane , that is created by chemical reactions in the crust beneath the seafloor.
now scientists have found vast deep water gas hydrates in the arctic that are reservoirs for abiotic methane â a gas which is 20 times more effective in trapping heat than carbon dioxide.
serpentinisation occurs when seawater reacts with hot mantle rocks exhumed along large faults within the seafloor the reservoirs are secure , and scientists do n't believe they will impact climate change
