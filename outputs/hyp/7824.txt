england could have a separate income tax rate to scotland under radical new reforms which will be introduced within 100 days of a tory election victory , cameron announced today.
the prime minister pledged to deliver effective â home rule â for england - giving mps the same powers to set tax rates which have been agreed for scotland following last year 's independent referendum.
mr cameron said in the interests of fairness england mps must be given a veto on legislation that no longer applies in scotland.
it will mean england , wales and northern irish mps being able to set a separate rate of income tax to that in scotland â where the snp is expected to hold sway after the election â with mps north of the border having no say
