a couple bought a beanie baby for Â£ 10 at a car boot sale - and later realised it was worth Â£ 62,500.
leah rogers and ryan flanaghan were selling a range of toys at the boot sale in bude , cornwall , when they spotted the purple teddy at another seller 's stall.
as a former collector , mr ryan flanaghan , 22 , recognised the bear as a limited edition princess diana di beanie baby - one of the most sought after in the collection which can be worth thousands of pounds.
they are now selling it on ebay , with a starting bid of Â£ 20,000 but the builder was stunned to find out that the bear was one of just 100 made around the world - and that another version is currently listed on ebay for Â£ 62,500
