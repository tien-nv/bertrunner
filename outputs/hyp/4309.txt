a holocaust survivor who last week forgave a 93 - year - old former ss officer - known as the ' bookkeeper of death ' - has angered her fellow plaintiffs by saying he should not be prosecuted.
kor , 81 , who publicly embraced oskar groening in court last week in an extraordinary act of forgiveness , called for the prosecutions of former ss officers to end.
in response , her co-plaintiffs released a statement through their lawyers today saying : ' our clients would not comment here â who better than a survivor of auschwitz knows that everyone needs to find their own way to overcome their suffering â if mrs kor did not repeatedly stage her ' forgiveness ' publicly.
' the subject of this criminal procedure is not that mr oskar groening has done anything personally to mrs kor or any of the other co-plaintiffs
