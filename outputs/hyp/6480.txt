clinton 's family 's charities are refiling at least five years of tax returns after an investigation revealed they had misreported tens of millions of dollars in donations from governments.
the charities ' errors generally took the form of under - reporting or over-reporting donations from foreign governments , or in other instances , omitted to break out government donations entirely when reporting revenue , the charities confirmed to reuters , which uncovered the mistakes.
following the discovery , the clinton foundation and the clinton health access initiative said they will be refiling multiple annual tax returns and may audit returns extending as far back as 15 years in case there have been other errors.
the unsettled numbers on the tax returns are not evidence of wrongdoing but tend to undermine the 990s role as a form of public accountability , experts in charity law and transparency advocates told reuters
