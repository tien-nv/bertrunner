tokyo a japan court has issued a landmark injunction halting plans to restart two nuclear reactors in the west of the country , citing safety concerns , a court official told cnn.
japan 's nuclear watchdog , the nuclear regulation authority , had previously given a green light to the reopening of reactors 3 and 4 of the kansai electric power company 's takahama nuclear plant.
but locals successfully petitioned the court in fukui prefecture , where the plant is located , raising concerns about whether the reactors would survive a strong earthquake.
japan 's 48 nuclear reactors are offline in the wake of the fukushima disaster in 2011 , when a tsunami triggered by a massive earthquake sent a wall of water crashing into the power plant
