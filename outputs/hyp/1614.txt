rodgers has launched an impassioned defence of his abilities , insisting there is nobody better equipped to manage liverpool under the fenway sports group model.
it has been a difficult week for rodgers , with the meek manner of last sunday âs 2 - 1 defeat by aston villa in the fa cup semi-final ensuring his position has come under scrutiny like at no point during his three - year reign at the club.
