a ' superhero ' scientist has ventured into one of the most radioactive places in the world - scaling missile defence system towers , getting bitten by ' radioactive ' ants and eating contaminated apples that have grown on trees close to chernobyl 's epicentre.
anonymous scientist bionerd has attracted thousands of subscribers to her youtube channel for her visits into the chernobyl exclusion zone , the site of a devastating nuclear explosion 29 years ago on april 26 , 1986 , as she measures the high levels of radiation still lingering in the air.
since the disaster the site has been closed off to the world , with ukraine scientists agreeing that the area is n't habitable for humans for at least 20,000 years.
despite this , the daredevil researcher claims she has exposed herself to more radiation swimming in the sea and visiting hospital - and says the most scared she 's felt during her six visits was getting dangerously close to a rabid fox and walking by abandoned , dilapidated buildings
