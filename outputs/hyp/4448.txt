there is a problem with england 's top order and it is not an easy one to solve.
england 's top three are exceptional players but the issue is that they are very one - paced and when the west indies bowling was so disciplined , that became a problem on the first morning of the first test.
it is ok batting the way england did if they had got through to lunch on 60 without loss , but they will be exposed against better teams than west indies , like australia , if they crash to 34 for three in the first session as they did here.
joe root ( left ) and ian bell ( right ) put on 177 runs for the fourth wicket on day one in antigua ian bell raises his bat to the crowd after scoring his 22nd test match century at the sir viv richards stadium ok , if they stay in the runs will come and england supporters will be happy but it should be remembered that england have promised to play a certain way
