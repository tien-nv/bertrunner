begiristain was on the 10.30am lufthansa flight out of manchester for munich on tuesday morning.
it âs the week of the champions league quarter - finals , therefore the manchester city director of football would have expected to be on the move.
the thought of begiristain and his favourite coach , pep guardiola , in the same stadium as bayern attempt to turn over a 3 - 1 first leg deficit to porto certainly provides some appropriate imagery.
pep guardiola is the man begiristain would like to install at manchester city in the summer of 2016
