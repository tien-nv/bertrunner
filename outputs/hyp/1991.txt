endangered bears kept in cramped metal cages on bile farms in vietnamese are dying at a rate of two a day , a mailonline investigation has found.
more than 700 asiatic black bears , over a third of those held in captivity in vietnamese , have allegedly been butchered in the past year alone â with up to four bears inexplicably killed in one day on some farms.
farmers claim the extinction - threatened bears are dying from disease and old age â but sources say owners are killing them to ' extract the last ounce of blood ' and selling their body parts to make china medicine.
