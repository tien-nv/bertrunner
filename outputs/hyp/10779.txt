the reserve deputy who shot a suspect with his firearm rather than his stun gun , and another deputy who can be heard cursing at the suspect after he was shot , were not in their normal states of mind because of the elevated stress of apprehending the suspect , according to a tulsa , oklahoma , investigator.
tulsa police sgt. clark , who has been brought in to review the case , said tulsa county reserve deputy bates , 73 , " inadvertently " shot harris after harris -- a possibly pcp - addled felon who had days prior sold methamphetamine to an undercover officer -- ran from authorities after trying to sell an illegal handgun during an undercover sting.

he warned his fellow deputies he was going to use a taser on the suspect , but instead , he fired a single gunshot -- and immediately apologized , clark said , citing a recently released video
