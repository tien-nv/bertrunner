the device , called the illume arclighter , creates a â super high - intensity â electrical arc and contains a rechargeable lithium - ion battery so users will never run out of fuel at a tricky moment again.
a bright idea : a new lighter ( pictured ) uses electricity to ignite candles and paper for example , and it âs claimed to be the first flameless gadget of its kind its inventors , based in edmonton , canada , are raising money to put the lighter into production on kickstarter and have almost doubled their goal.
instead of using a spark and fuel mechanism like traditional lighters , the illume arclighter creates a â super high - intensity â electrical arc between two ceramic electrodes.
