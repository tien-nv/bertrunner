the light in these extraordinary images has travelled so far that it has taken 4,200 years to get here.
the two images were taken 18 years apart , the first with the karl g. jansky very large array in new mexico in 1996 and the second by an international team of astronomers led by the national autonomous university of mexico ( national autonomous university of mexico ) last year.
a simulated image from 1996 is on the left , and another from 2014 is on the right the star â known as w75n ( b ) - vla2 â is 300 times brighter and eight times bigger than our sun , although it is masked by a black cloud of space dust.
on the right right , as seen in 2014 , the hot wind has been shaped by encountering a dusty , doughnut - shaped torus around the star and appears elongated in the 1996 picture there is a relatively small region of space wind surrounding the star
