sipping a glass of glorious red wine which has been carefully aged in a hand - crafted oak barrel is my idea of heaven.
but until now the only way to enjoy a tipple with that gorgeous authentic taste that can only develop through spending years in a special wooden cask has been to pay through the nose.
the second i see the word â spicy â on a bottle label ( which suggests an oaky flavouring ) , i instantly know the price will be much higher.
a Â£ 5 bottle has suddenly become Â£ 12 because the wine has lingered in an oak barrel before bottling
