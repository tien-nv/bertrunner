scientists at a polish company that produce body armour systems are working to put a ' magic liquid ' that can harden on impact in their products.
the liquid is called shear-thickening fluid ( stf ) , and instantly hardens upon impact at any temperature.
in a ' liquid armour ' this provides protection from penetration by high - speed projectiles and additionally dispersing energy over a larger area.
' the liquid has been used to create lightweight flexible sheets , which can be placed inside the body armour when hit by a high - speed projectile , a wide area of the stf hardens instantly , causing the usually massive energy to be dispersed away from the wearer 's internal organs
