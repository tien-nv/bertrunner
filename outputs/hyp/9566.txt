a grieving son was forced to dig his mother 's grave after a council ' co-ordination error ' meant work had not been done to the burial plot.
gee made the almost six hour journey from his home outside brisbane to wandoan in regional queensland , only to find the local council failed to dig a spot where he could place his mother 's ashes.
mr gee planned to place his mother , elizabeth hobbs , who died last year , with his father , alex gee , who died in 1964.
mr gee makes the journey to the site every year to remember his father , and this year he wanted to follow through on a promise he made to his mother to reunite the pair
