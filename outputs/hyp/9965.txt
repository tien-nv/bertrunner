anaesthetic gases used to send patients to sleep during surgery are accumulating in the earth 's atmosphere where they are contributing to climate change.
scientists say they have detected the gases used in anaesthetic as far a field as antarctic and concentrations have been rising globally in the past decade.
the gases - desflurane , isoflurane and sevoflurane - are potent greenhouse gases that have 2,500 times the impact on global warming compared to carbon dioxide.
anaesthetic is used to send patients to sleep during surgery ( above ) but it may also be warming the planet atmospheric scientists who have been monitoring the gases say that while the concentrations in the atmosphere are low , they are having an increasing effect on the climate
