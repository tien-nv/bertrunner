a local council has been criticised for banning an indian food stall from a st george 's day event because it ' only wanted english food '.
british - born stall - holder tania rahman , 27 , was asked by salisbury city council if she wanted to run a stand at the celebration later this month.
but when she asked to be counted in she was told her stall , chit chaat chai , would not be allowed because it is not ' english - themed '.
' discriminatory ' : tania rahman received a letter from salisbury city council telling her it would not accept her offer to run a food stall at a st george 's day event because it ' only wanted english food ' the council has now apologised after their response sparked a backlash from locals - who pointed out that chicken tikka masala is a british - made dish
