balls was today accused of ' letting the cat out of the bag ' on tax rises after leaving the door open to trapping more middle - class workers in the 40p tax rate.
in an interview the shadow chancellor repeatedly refused to rule out trying to balance the books by lowering the amount workers have to earn before they pay the higher income tax rate.
the number of people paying 40p tax has already risen from about 2million to 5million in two decades , but the tory have promised to lift the threshold if they are returned to power.
but pressed on income tax , mr balls refused to rule out freezing or lowering the threshold to raise millions from people earning more than Â£ 41,865
