the terrorist group al-shabaab has claimed an attack on garissa university college in eastern kenyan , in which many people have been killed and still more taken hostage.
the attack is another step in the ongoing escalation of the terrorist group 's activities , and a clear indicator that the security situation in east africa is deteriorating fast.
somalia - based al-shabaab has been behind a string of recent attacks in kenyan , the most well - known of them being the massacre at the westgate shopping centre in nairobi in 2013.
al-shabaab incursions triggered a military response by the government in nairobi , which sent troops to somalia as part of an african union mission in support of somalia 's internationally recognized government that had been under pressure from al-shabaab and other militants for several years
