a weakening us economy spilled into the job market in march as employers added just 126,000 jobs 0the fewest since december 2013 â snapping a 12 - month streak of gains above 200,000.
the unemployment rate remained at 5.5 percent , the labor department said in its monthly report friday.
the march jobs data raised uncertainties about the world 's largest economy , which for months has been the envy of other industrialized nations for its steadily robust hiring and growth.
employers now appear wary about the economy , especially as a strong dollar has slowed us exports , home sales have sputtered and cheaper gasoline has yet to unleash more consumer spending
