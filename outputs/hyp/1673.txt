teachers can judge the behaviour of black students more harshly than while pupils , new research has suggested.
a study by researchers at stanford university examined the reaction of secondary and primary school teachers in the us to student race.
they found that the teachers were more likely to view youngsters who they thought were black as troublemakers than those they thought were white.
teachers tend to see black pupils as more likely to cause trouble in the future if they have misbehaved in the past , according to new research that attempted to examine the impact of racial stereotypes in us schools the researchers say this may go someway towards explaining why black children are often disciplined more at schools compared to other pupils
