spacex , the private space exploration company founded by billionaire musk , hopes to give it a try.
spacex said on twitter that tuesday at 4:10 p.m. et will be the next opportunity for the company to launch a two - stage falcon 9 rocket carrying an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called dragon on a flight from cape canaveral , florida , to the international space station.
after the launch , spacex will try to guide the bottom stage of the rocket upright onto a platform , or what it calls an autonomous spaceport drone ship , in the atlantic ocean off florida.
dragon will dock with the space station a couple of days after launch to deliver more than 4,300 pounds ( 1,950 kilograms ) of supplies , including research equipment and isspresso , an espresso maker that astronauts can use to make coffee and tea
