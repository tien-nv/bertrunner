gorkha , nepalese the ride from kathmandu to near the epicenter of nepalese 's devastating earthquake is not for those who get easily carsick.
steep slopes and small winding roads through deep river valleys greet us as we make our way to a town where nepalese and international medical teams are treating the injured , in much less than ideal circumstances.
although i see numerous landslides , i am surprised that the villages we are driving through are relatively unaffected.
one of the biggest challenges rescue workers are facing in nepalese is reaching affected people in remote mountainous areas
