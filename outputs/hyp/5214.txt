a father has discovered that facebook photos of him and his seven - year - old daughter were used to set up a fake account and scam an austria woman out of $ 4,000.
valente , from dallas , texas , first learned of the ruse when he received a message from marianne heinrich , who lives in vienna , two weeks ago , he told nbc.
she told him that someone using the name ' johnson michael lynn ' had created a fake facebook profile using photos of him and his daughter before befriending heinrich online.
among the photographs shared by ' johnson michael lynn ' was also a photoshopped image showing valente 's face oddly placed on another person 's body in hospital
