villa deserved their victory at wembley on sunday and there were two players at the heart of it all.
jack grealish was fantastic but delph was the best player on the pitch.
as for grealish , for a young man to play like that on his first visit to wembley was magnificent.
jack grealish , delph and christian benteke celebrate as villa reached the fa cup final delph shoots and scores against liverpool goalkeeper simon mignolet to put villa ahead at wembley he is quick but has a languid style , like steve mcmanaman
