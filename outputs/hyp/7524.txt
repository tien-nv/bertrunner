kitted out : mr carney out running in hyde park just how many water bottles does a man need when running ? if you âre the governor of the bank of england , the answer seems to be four.
carney was spotted on a day off from helping to run the economy jogging in london âs hyde park sporting a high - tech running belt with no fewer than four water bottles.
the keen runner , who training for the london marathon later this month , was wearing a nathan speed 4 fuel belt , which also features a zip pocket perfect for storing high - carb energy gel packs.
the belt is available for $ 64.95 ( Â£ 35 ) at kintec , a canada sports retailer based in vancouver , suggesting mr carney , originally from canada , bought it before he moved to the uk
