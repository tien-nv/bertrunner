liverpool 's fa cup semi-final defeat has put the club under scrutiny and guaranteed this campaign will be judged a failure.
the burning ambition at anfield is for liverpool to be champions league regulars with the potential to win the barclays premier league.
but , after a wretched day against villa , they are clearly some way from realising that dream.
are liverpool heading for mediocrity ? or is there sufficient talent to ensure the mistakes are corrected and progress can be resumed ? a huge summer beckons and there is no margin for error
