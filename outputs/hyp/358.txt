sir james munby says parents should use the ' carrot and the stick ' approach to getting their children to do things they do n't want to do the job of parents is to make their children do the things they do not want to do , the country âs most senior family law judge said yesterday.
mothers and fathers should use the â carrot and the stick â approach to make children do the things they find boring or difficult â from going to the dentist to doing their homework , sir james munby said.
he suggested confiscating mobiles and electronic gadgets , grounding teenagers , and â threats falling short of brute force â as suitable methods for parents to get their way.
the price of failure , the judge suggested , could be lifelong pain for the parents or even , if the children âs education or health was at stake , their removal by social workers to grow up in state care
