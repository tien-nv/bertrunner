a financial fund for killer cop slager was shut down by crowd - funding website , gofundme , on wednesday.
the site told daily mail online that ' after review by our team , the campaign set up for officer slager was removed due to a violation of gofundme 's terms & conditions ' but refused to elaborate due to privacy concerns.
slager has been charged with the murder of unarmed black father coast guard , 50 , who was fatally shot five times in the back in north charleston , south carolina on saturday.
a separate fundraising campaign was started on site , indiegogo , titled the ' michael t. slager support fund ' and featured a picture of slager in his police uniform
