an islamic state sympathizer who was plotting to carry out an attack on a american military base similar to the deadly assault at fort hood in 2009 has been arrested.
john t. booker jr , was detained in manhattan , kansas , on friday morning and charged with multiple terror offenses , including attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction.
the 20 - year - old , who refers to himself as muhammad abdullah hassan , is said to have targeted nearby fort riley and planned to use a 1,000lb car bomb to blow himself up and kill ' people with power '.
booker was shown how to arm the bomb , which was actually a dud , and taken to a supposed secret gate to enter the base by fbi informants before being arrested around 9am
