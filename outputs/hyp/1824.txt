but on saturday night , bush apparently lashed out at the president 's foreign policy.
speaking at a closed - door meeting with jewish donors in las vegas , the 68 - year - old former leader suggested that obama 's plan to lift sanctions on iran was not plausible - and comes too early.
he noted that the country 's government and president hassan rouhani appear to be caving in - and implied that us could lose leverage if it relaxes sanctions on tehran anytime soon.
bush 's concerns are in stark contrast to obama 's belief that although the contents of the agreement - which were announced at the start of april - ' may not be optimal , ' they are us 's ' best bet '
