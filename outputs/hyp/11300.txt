for more than four days , police say , a 21 - year - old quadriplegic with cerebral palsy was left lying in the woods of philadelphia 's cobbs creek park with only a blanket and a bible.
the person responsible is the man 's mother , who on sunday faced a host of charges after allegedly abandoning her son and catching a bus to maryland to see her boyfriend , said philadelphia police lt. walker.
the man is unable to communicate how he came to be in the park , but walker told reporters that the man 's mother , whom he did not identify for cnn , left him there monday morning.
" sometime at 11 a.m. , the mother went to visit her boyfriend down in maryland , over in montgomery county , and we believe she placed the child into cobbs creeks park , " walker said at a news conference
