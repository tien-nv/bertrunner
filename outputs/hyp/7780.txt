lawyers for a high school honor student in massachusetts say the teen is ' bewildered ' over the involuntary manslaughter charges against her following the suicide of her friend , as they push to have the case moved to a different county due to ' a conflict of interest '.
michelle carter , 18 , looked glum as she appeared in court in new bedford on thursday accused of encouraging the death of roy , who gassed himself in his truck in fairhaven last july.
during the hearing her defense attorney requested the case be moved out of bristol county , saying it 's ' impossible ' for carter to receive a fair trial in the area because the district attorney is the victim 's third cousin.
authorities claim carter , of plainville , texted with roy minutes before he killed himself in the parking lot of a fairhaven store
