the investigation into the crash of germanwings flight 9525 has not revealed evidence of the co-pilot lubitz 's motive , but he suffered from suicidal tendencies at some point before his aviation career , a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office in dusseldorf , german , said monday.
investigators have not found any writings or conversations where lubitz shared his motives or confessed to any plans , prosecutor 's spokesman kumpa said.
however , medical records reveal that lubitz was suicidal at one time and underwent psychotherapy.
kumpa emphasized there 's no evidence suggesting lubitz was suicidal or acting aggressively before the crash
