as the sun sets on the saharan desert , its colours cast a glow on its vast sand dunes causing rainbow light to dance across the landscape.
and nasa has captured how this stunning show appears from space using its landsat 7 satellite.
it shows ' ribbons ' of sand and patterned stripes known as linear dunes in the erg chech , a desolate sand sea in southwestern algeria - but the exact cause of these longitudinal structures is not known.
linear dunes , like these captured by nasa 's landsat 7 satellite , are straight ridges of sand that have been known to measure as long as 99 miles ( 160km )
