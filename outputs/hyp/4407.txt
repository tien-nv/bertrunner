frankie dettori will be left to focus on the british season this summer after boss sheik joaan al thani signed up gregory benoist to ride the horses which race under his al shaqab banner in france.
the only exception will be sheik joaan âs dual arc winner treve , who will continue to be partnered by veteran thierry jarnet.
frankie dettori is to concentrate on the british flat season and not being picked to ride in france the recruitment of gregory benoist could be seen as a snub for frankie dettori , who was replaced by thierry jarnet on treve in the build - up to her arc success.
gregory benoist is the rider signed up to race the al shaqab banner in france this summer â frankie dettori is happy with it and he will still ride british horses which we send to run in france
