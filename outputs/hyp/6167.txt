talk about a chain reaction ! this is the moment a billiards player performs a complex trick shot by setting up a domino train to pot four balls do n't blink : video footage shows a white ball being rolled down a positioned cue - it then bounces off one side of the red - clothed table and hits the first in a long line of dominoes going , going , gone : one by one the small counters fall down , tapping balls into pockets as they go - first a yellow , then a blue , then a red clear table : finally , the last domino gently hits an orange ball , causing it to roll down another positioned cue lying on the table
