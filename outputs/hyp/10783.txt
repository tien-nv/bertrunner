mullah mullah omar is " still the leader " of the taliban 's self - declared islamic emirate of afghan.
that appears to be the primary message of a biography , just published by the taliban , of the reclusive militant who is credited with founding the group in the early 1990s.
the taliban 's " cultural commission " released the 11 - page document in several different translations on the movement 's website , ostensibly to commemorate the 19th anniversary of an april 4 , 1996 , meeting in afghan 's kandahar province when an assembly of afghan swore allegiance to mullah omar.
several afghan observers say the biography is aimed at dispelling rumors of mullah omar 's demise
