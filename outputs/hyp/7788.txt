militants fighting for the islamic state in iraqi have savagely executed 10 doctors who refused to treat wounded members of the terrorist organisation.
isis jihadis are understood to have been fighting local groups in the hammam al-alil area when several of them sustained injuries requiring medical treatment.
local official mowaffaq hamid al-azawi described the city of mosul as a big open - air prison , where residents are subjected to barbaric torture at the hands of the isis terrorists.
iraqi army soldiers and the iran - backed volunteer shiite militias allied with the iraqi regime have had great success in pushing isis out of key towns and villages recently
