madrid have n't got going tonight ( i was about to write a post about how barcelona were 5 - 0 up at this point ) but rodriguez produces a bit of individual magic to opening the scoring.
39mins : as bad as madrid have been , credit must go to almeria.
3mins : almeria have quite a bit of the ball early on but unsurprisingly it 's madrid who almost force the opening.
minutes until kick - off now , madrid will be hoping to follow barcelona 's lead and turn on the style too
