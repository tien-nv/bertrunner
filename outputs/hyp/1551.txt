a mother of four has pledged to remove her children from school to attend an ancient maypole festival - despite facing fines or even prosecution.
james , 32 , has vowed to defy the school 's ban on taking her children to the ' obby ' oss celebrations - claiming the rituals are part of her ' religion , culture and heritage.
' the school blocked her request under a government crackdown on unauthorised absences announced in 2013.
