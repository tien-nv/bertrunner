some of the oldest surviving photographs of the houses of parliament and windsor castle , dating back more than 150 years , have been found.
the remarkable images were shot by photographer prout , who developed the negatives in an improvised dark room on board his punt which he sailed along the river thames.
prout travelled around the river thames on his boat to capture images of the well known landmarks , developing them on the spot his floating dark room construction is often seen tethered to a skiff in some of the photographs.
the photographer was known for his panoramic images , such as this one taken overlooking the river thames , of richmond bridge richmond bridge today is busier than the scene surrounding the 18th century stone bridge captured by prout around 150 years ago the buildings and riverside of marlow was captured in a photograph taken by prout , who then developed his pictures as quickly as he could today 's picture of marlow - with the church spire dominating - bears a striking resemblance to that taken by proust , more than 150 years ago the images , such as this of iffley , were saved by prout in his book of pictures of the river thames in the mid 1850s and will now be auctioned some of the photos capture how the areas have changed , such as at iffley where the watermill no longer stands after it was burned to the ground in 1908 , having survived for almost 800 years prout 's photography along the river thames included this shot of twickenham in the 1950s , with his darkroom boat in the foreground ( right ) twickenham has been significantly developed since the 1850s when prout captured his image of the london suburb along the river thames the photos - believed to be the the first documented collection of the uk 's greatest river - were eventually published by prout 's father 's publishing company , virtue and co , in around 1862
