after more than two years of inexorable decline the patience of tranmere 's faithful finally snapped when oxford moved decisively ahead , in an effortless manner reminiscent of the previous saturday 's boat race.
the loathing was directed mainly at manager micky adams , who was announced on sunday morning to have left the club by ' mutual consent '.
