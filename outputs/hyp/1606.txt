when it launched eight years ago , cruise company azamara club cruises decided to make a name for itself , literally.
the founders took ' aza ' for ' blue ' - think azure ; and added ' mara ' , which has a hint of the maritime about it.
the line - part of the royal caribbean group - has two ships in its fleet , journey and azamara quest , which each carry about 680 passengers.
the smaller size of the vessels means not only a more intimate on - board experience - as in tv 's cheers bar , it can become a place where everybody who serves you soon knows your name - it also means the ships can access ports off - limits to the bigger vessels
