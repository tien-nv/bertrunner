a fiery stoush has erupted between the chief executive of murdoch 's media empire in australian and a senator who questioned why the company runs a national newspaper at a multi-million dollar loss.
during a tumultuous day of proceedings at a corporate tax inquiry in sydney today , news corp australia ceo clarke was peppered with questions from greens senator and party leader milne about why the australian newspaper operates as a business when it is not profitable.
when mr clarke defended the newspaper as the ' finest national newspaper operating in australian ' , ms milne flatly told the inquiry , ' you and i wo n't agree on that '.
mr clarke also rejected allegations recently published by fairfax media alleging $ 4.5 billion had been siphoned from mr murdoch 's australian operations to the united states virtually tax free
