a flaw in robots designed to perform surgery has been found that lets them be easily hacked , according to researchers.
the experts were able to take control of a so - called telerobot during surgery by exploiting a simple programming trick.
this enabled them to change the speed of the arms of the robot and change their orientation , making it impossible for the machines to carry out a procedure as directed.
this is because they are operated over public networks which allowed the researchers to access them and stop them working the research was carried out by scientists at the university of washington by toying with a product from their own university - the raven ii teleoperated robotical surgeon
