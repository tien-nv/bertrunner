blackburn are in familiar territory facing an fa cup replay against one of the country 's best , only this time it 's liverpool and not city.

none - the-less , midfielder tom cairney did n't come away from the game empty handed and grabbed yaya toure 's shirt at the end , which takes pride of place framed in his living room.
' i do n't know what he did with mine , i think he needed something to clean his car with ! ' tom cairney jokes , hoping that there will not be a repeat when they host liverpool on wednesday in their fa cup quarter - final replay
