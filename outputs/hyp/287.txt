with a steyr assault rifle pulled tight into his shoulder , the harry is pictured taking part in exercises with royal australian artillery troops in darwin.

at the end of the exercises in the northern territory , prince harry will hang up his fatigues and , after attending official functions in perth and sydney , is expected to return to uk
