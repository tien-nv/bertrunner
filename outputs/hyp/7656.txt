who does nât love a hot cross bun at easter ? in britain we so enjoy the spiced , sweet rolls with a cross on top , that they used to be eaten all year round.
that was until queen elizabeth i tried to ban them , possibly finding the cross a little too catholic.
the move was greeted with uproar , so she compromised , saying they could only be sold on good friday , at christmas and for burials â and they have been prime easter fare ever since.
