two best mates from rural victoria have vowed to keep aussie lingo alive by making memorabilia that encapsulates the fading vernacular.
jeff mccubbery , 72 , from mandurang and ian bullock , 65 , from blackburn devised the plan for captain cootie cards over twenty years ago in a bid to counter the influx of lingo from overseas.
the pair now has a quirky range of greeting cards , coffee mugs , stubby - holders and calendars â but their hopes of spreading the message were dashed after they were spurned by the companies they pitched their products to.
