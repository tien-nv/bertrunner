london police said thursday that there was no sign of forced entry to a building in a spectacular holiday weekend heist of safe deposit boxes in the heart of london 's jewelry district.
detective chief inspector johnson of the london metropolitan police flying squad said the thieves appeared to have gained access to the vault of hatton garden safe deposit ltd through the shaft of an elevator that is used by several businesses in the building.
the thieves disabled the elevator on the second floor of the building -- which would be the same as the third floor in the united states -- then climbed down the elevator shaft into the basement , he said.
