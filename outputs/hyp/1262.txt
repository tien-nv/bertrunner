leicester boss nigel pearson has called for realism in their survival quest and insisted that their remaining fixtures will make it extremely tough to avoid relegation.
they will escape the drop zone for the first time since november if they beat swansea at home on saturday by three goals and burnley fail to win at everton.
they also have to face relegation rivals sunderland and burnley away while welcoming qpr to the king power stadium on the final day of the season.
back - to - back wins revived leicester âs hopes of top - flight survival but nigel pearson wants to keep a lid on expectations
