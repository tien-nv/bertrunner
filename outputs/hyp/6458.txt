blindness did n't stop one new hampshire man from taking on the tough mudder last week , where he was one of only 10 percent of competitors to successfully ring a bell while swinging on a rope 25 feet in the air.
pierce , from nashua , may now gearing up to run the boston marathon this month , but there was once a time he could n't walk at all.
pierce lost his sight when he was just 22 years old , from a neurological disease that also left him in a wheelchair.
